<p><span class="smcap">Fortuitous</span> circumstances having
occasioned me to become an inhabitant of Llangollen, I was
charmed with the beauty of its situation; and the political
importance in which this neighbourhood was formerly held prompted
me to collect a few notices of its local history, which I was
advised by some of my friends to publish.&nbsp; The condescending
politeness of the Ladies of Plas Newydd, in permitting me to
dedicate my Work to them, encouraged me to proceed; and I now
venture to present my little Book to the Public, earnestly hoping
that its defects will not be found such as to render it deserving
of severe criticism, and that it will prove generally useful.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>Llangollen<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
ITS VICINITY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here let me still with simple Nature
live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My lowly field-flowers on her altar lay;<br />
Enjoy the blessings that she meant to give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And calmly pass my inoffensive day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attraction of North Wales, by
its romantic scenery, the antiquity of its language, and the well
authenticated records of its desperate struggle for independence,
renders every part of the Principality interesting, and perhaps
none more so than the beautifully picturesque town and
neighbourhood of Llangollen, which have deservedly excited <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the attention
and admiration of a vast number of strangers and
antiquarians.&nbsp; Nor have the expectations of its numerous
visitors been disappointed; for, though the Alps may raise their
towering summits to a greater height&mdash;may embosom in their
dark recesses more ample lakes, and give rise to more magnificent
rivers&mdash;yet even they cannot present a more pleasing variety
of scenery, or more picturesque views, than those with which
Llangollen is surrounded.</p>
<p>This small market town is on the border of North Wales, and is
situated in that part of the county of Denbigh which adjoins
Shropshire.&nbsp; It is on the south <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a> bank of the river Dee,
and the mail road from London to Holyhead passes through the
town.&nbsp; <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>The distance from London to Llangollen is about one
hundred and ninety miles, and from the latter place to Holyhead
seventy-seven miles.</p>
<p>The town consists of one long badly paved street, and a short
cross one, together with some courts and alleys, called squares,
but which at present ill deserve an appellation generally
conveying to the mind an idea of neatness, if not of superiority,
as they are for the most part formed with obscure mean-looking
houses, built of the dark-coloured silicious stone procured from
the rocky bed of the river, and from the surrounding hills.&nbsp;
The houses are seldom more than two stories high, and have a very
sombre appearance, except where the owners have had the good
taste to avail themselves of the lime <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>which is near at hand, in
rough-casting or plastering the fronts.&nbsp; The difference of
the appearance of the buildings thus finished is so advantageous
that it is to be hoped the plan will be generally adopted.</p>
<p>Increase of population has here the effect which is usually
attributed to it, viz. a manifest improvement in the town.&nbsp;
The last census states the number of houses at 289, and of the
population at 1287; but the inhabitants may at this time (A.D.
1827) be fairly estimated at 1500, and habitations in
proportion.&nbsp; Among the newly-erected houses are some very
neat buildings, at which private lodgings may be obtained, with
every requisite accommodation.</p>
<p>Llangollen has a market on Saturday, and five fairs in the
year, viz. <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>on the last Friday in January, the 17th of March, the
31st of May, the 21st of August, and on the 22d of November; at
which, horses, horned cattle, pigs, butter, cheese, &amp;c. are
sold.&nbsp; A market house once stood where the Hand Gardens now
are, and is a convenience much wanted.&nbsp; Besides the London
Mail to Holyhead, which passes through Llangollen every afternoon
at five o&rsquo;clock, and leaves the letter bags, which it takes
up again about eight o&rsquo;clock every morning, there are
regular stage coaches passing to and from London and Holyhead
every day.&nbsp; Light vans, for the conveyance of luggage,
&amp;c. pass twice a week from Salop.&nbsp; There are also waggon
conveyances, through Wrexham, to Chester; and boats on a
collateral branch of the Ellesmere Canal, which start at stated
periods for Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>There are
twelve licensed inns and public houses in this little town, all
of them very respectable; and whether it is owing to superior
management, or to the excellence of the water, which is the most
pure imaginable, and flows abundantly in every part of the town,
the ale brewed in Llangollen is in great and deserved repute all
over the kingdom.</p>
<p>Two principal inns and hotels adorn the town&mdash;the Hand
inn, which is in the centre, near the church; and the
King&rsquo;s Head, at the west end, near the bridge.&nbsp; The
excellent accommodations afforded in both of them are not
surpassed; they are under the best regulations, and abound with
elegance and convenience.&nbsp; Post carriages and horses are
kept at both houses, and the harp resounds in their halls.&nbsp;
The Viceroys of the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>sister kingdom, as well as the nobility, seem to regard
Llangollen as a favourite resting-place, in passing from one
country to the other.</p>
<p>Mountains and hills enclose the town on every side.&nbsp; On
the south, the Berwyn Mountains raise their lofty heads.&nbsp; On
the north, Castell Dinas Bran, vulgarly called Crow Castle,
seated on its conical summit, frowns over the town in ruined
grandeur, and is backed with the vast and wonderful range of
lime-stone, which forms a ridge stratum super stratum, and is
called the Eglwyseg Rocks.&nbsp; A portion of these rocks, with
the little tumulus-like hill of Pen y Coed, forms the eastern
barrier.&nbsp; On the west, the lofty Gerant, <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> or <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Moel y Barbwr, with the Bwlch Coedd
Herddyn, and other distant mountains, close the scene.</p>
<p>The sacred Dee, which here foams along its rocky bed, is
crossed by a stone bridge at the western extremity of the town;
the church stands in the centre; and at the east end is Plas
Newydd, the residence of the two highly respected ladies whom
Miss Seward has recorded in song.</p>
<p>Having thus given a brief sketch of Llangollen, embosomed as
it is in a vale where all the beauties of nature seem to
concentre, I shall proceed to retrace and fill up the outline of
the picture, by classing under the <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>name of each remarkable place its
description, and the particulars of its history, quoting from and
referring to authorities as I proceed; but as, from the varied
scenery and the romantic views with which this neighbourhood
abounds, an attempt to do justice to its several beauties would
be vain, I shall abstain from endeavouring fully to describe what
requires a more nervous hand than mine to paint; leaving to the
reader&rsquo;s taste full scope to select the scenes most
congenial to his disposition, assuring him, that whether the
dreary waste, over whose vast plains sterility and barrenness
hold eternal sway; or the luxuriance of verdant meads and shady
groves&mdash;the sombre haunts of secluded retirement; or the
soul-inspiring gaiety of nature in her most lightsome
mood&mdash;be most in unison with his frame of mind, here <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>may be found
solace for the melancholy, amusement for the gay, exercise for
the naturalist, and food for the antiquarian and philosopher.</p>
<p>As a commencement of my proposed tour, I shall now beg my
reader to accompany me on the north side of the Dee, to Clawdd
Offa, or Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the ancient boundary of this part of
the Principality.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Clawdd
Offa.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The best concerted schemes men lay for
fame<br />
Die fast away.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O lamentable sight! at once<br />
The labours of whole ages lumber down,<br />
A hideous and misshapen mass of ruin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Offa</span> was the eleventh King of
Mercia, and succeeded Ethelbald, A.D. 757.&nbsp; He was born
deaf, lame, and blind.&nbsp; About the year 776, <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a> he caused a deep ditch and rampire to
be made across the country, to curb the incursions of the Welch,
beginning at the waters of the Dee, at Basingwerke Abbey, in
Flintshire, to the river Wye, in Herefordshire; <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> or, as some say, to the Severn
sea.&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Like the famous wall of China, it is carried over
rivers, rocks, valleys, and mountains, and extends nearly one
hundred miles. <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; I intend to commence my
excursion with this ancient Dyke, and pursue it as far as is
consistent with my plan.&nbsp; It runs through the parish of
Ruabon, which is on the west side.</p>
<h2>Ruabon, or Rhiwabon,</h2>
<p>Is a neat pleasant village, about six miles east of
Llangollen.&nbsp; It is surrounded by mines of coal, ironstone,
&amp;c. with which the neighbourhood abounds.&nbsp; One of the
recently formed joint stock companies, denominated the British
Iron Company, is said to have expended on two works in this
neighbourhood &pound;134,952. <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; There <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>are also
other large ironworks, &amp;c. within about two miles of the
town.</p>
<p>The church is dedicated to St. Mary, and is a very respectable
ancient structure.&nbsp; It has an excellent organ, and a pretty
font of white marble, both given by the late Sir W. W. Wynn,
Bart. who has left behind him a character for beneficence that
has been rarely if ever equalled.&nbsp; This is the burial-place
of the highly respected family of Wynnstay; and in the church are
some ancient monumental remembrances, as well as some more
recently erected ones, of Sir W. W. Wynn&rsquo;s ancestors, well
worthy inspection.&nbsp; Dr. Powel, from whose celebrated
translation of the Chronicle of Caradoc of Llancarvan I have
obtained much information, was Vicar of Ruabon in 1571, and was
buried here.&nbsp; The monumental records <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of Sir W. W.
Wynn&rsquo;s family are highly panegyrical; but I cannot in this
small work give copies of the epitaphs, and to record the good
deeds of this excellent family would fill a folio.</p>
<p>Adjoining the town of Ruabon, a road passes into the park, and
to the mansion, of</p>
<h2>Wynnstay,</h2>
<p>The hereditary estate of the ancient and honourable family of
Sir Watkyn Williams Wynn, Bart.&nbsp; A porter resides at a small
house on the left side of the entrance to the park, who admits
all strangers requesting it.&nbsp; A beautiful road leads to the
mansion, and large herds of deer exhibit their graceful forms and
agility among the surrounding trees.&nbsp; Offa&rsquo;s Dyke runs
through the grounds, which are of <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>very great extent, well wooded,
tastefully laid out, and kept in nice order.&nbsp; The house is
very extensive, and the stables also capacious.&nbsp; The
premises have acquired their present magnitude by various
additions made at different times by the possessors.</p>
<p>In the eleventh century it was the residence of Madog Gryffydd
Mailor, <a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> Lord of Bromfield, and of Dinas Bran,
near Llangollen.&nbsp; It was then called Wattstay, from another
old dyke still visible, named Watt&rsquo;s Dyke; and the space
between that and Offa&rsquo;s Dyke was a sort of neutral
territory, on which the Welch and Saxons used to traffic with
each other. <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; When the noble family of the
Wynns became its possessors, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the original name was changed to
Wynnstay.&nbsp; The house is replete with elegance and
convenience, and is the seat of hospitality as unbounded as the
benevolence of its owner&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Under the auspices
of the late and present noble possessors, both the edifice and
grounds have nearly attained the ne plus ultra of perfection; yet
at this time a vast addition is making to the magnitude of the
park, by changing the direction of the road to Oswestry.&nbsp; In
short, Wynnstay is one of the most beautiful seats, not only in
Wales, but even in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the park stands a fluted freestone column, erected to the
memory of the late Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart. by his mother, who
survived him.&nbsp; The elevation, after a design by Wyatt, is
about one hundred feet, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and is surmounted by a bronze
urn.&nbsp; The base also is of bronze, decorated with eagles and
oak leaves, and bears this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Filio optimo, mater, eheu!
superstes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A surviving mother, alas! to the best of
sons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A spiral staircase runs within the pillar to the top, from
whence is a fine view of the park and grounds.</p>
<p>There are other recently erected decorative buildings on the
domain; one of which, called Waterloo Tower, and built to
commemorate the glorious victory obtained at Waterloo by the Duke
of Wellington, commands a very extensive prospect: on it a flag
is always displayed when Sir Watkyn is at Wynnstay.&nbsp; Another
tower is built on a most beautiful spot on <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the bank of
the Dee, called Nant y Bellan, i.e. the Dale of the Martin; and
was erected, as I learn from the Oration in the Ellesmere Report,
p. 24, to the memory of those ancient Britons who fell in
quelling a dangerous rebellion in a neighbouring island, now more
closely united to us.&nbsp; Near this place a boat is kept for
the purpose of crossing the river.</p>
<p>From the old house a road is continued on the rampire of
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke for nearly two miles, and bears the whimsical
title of Llwybr y Cath, i.e. Cat&rsquo;s Path, although it is
wide enough for two carriages to pass abreast.&nbsp; The ardent
and inquisitive traveller will find in the interesting domain of
Wynnstay much to examine, much to amuse, and much to admire.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Returning through the park to the high road, I crossed
the Dee over a recently erected iron bridge; and entering the
parish of Chirk, I soon regained Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the peculiar
features of which plainly distinguish it.&nbsp; The Dyke crosses
the road to London about two hundred yards to the west of
Whitehurst&rsquo;s new toll gate, and about four miles and a half
from Llangollen.&nbsp; Pursuing the line of the Dyke towards
Chirk Castle, I found in it a number of large and long grey
stones, mossed over, and lying confusedly at the bottom.&nbsp;
They are very remarkable, as there are no quarries in the
neighbourhood, from which such stones could be procured; and as
they all lay in one spot, I conjecture that they have been used
to mark the graves of the slain in the year 1165, when Henry II.
made his first expedition against <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>North Wales, by way of the Berwyn
Mountains:&mdash;&ldquo;He assembled a large army at Oswelt Tree,
and detached a number of men to try the passes into Wales.&nbsp;
There was a narrow way through the Dyke, near Castell Crogen, now
Chirk Castle; they were set upon by a party of Welchmen, as they
would have passed this strait, and many of them were there slain,
and buried in that ditch; where (says my Author) their graves are
now (i.e. 1697) to be seen.&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>The place was called Adwy&rsquo;r Beddau, i.e. Pass of the
Graves.&nbsp; There is a field or two near the place still called
Tir a Beddau, i.e. Land, or Field of the Dead.&nbsp; I visited
this place, and found the field under cultivation; and it is
possible that the <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>stones may have been removed out of the way of the
plough, to the place where they now lie.&nbsp; On examining an
old survey of Chirk Lordship, I found two or three parcels of
land lying contiguous to each other, and on each side of the
Dyke, at this place, bearing the same name, Tir y Beddau.</p>
<p>From this field of the dead I bent my way along the Dyke,
through bramble, bush, and brier, to the no small disturbance of
its numerous inhabitants, the nimble squirrels, the rabbits, and
the pheasants, springing before me every thirty or forty
yards.&nbsp; At length I arrived at the brink of a sheet of water
called the pool, on which numbers of wild ducks, coots, and other
aquatic birds were disporting.&nbsp; The ditch and rampire
continued through the middle of that pool, and the rampire is
still traceable <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>from the boat house on the opposite side; and running
along the ley in front of Chirk Castle to a wood yard on the west
side of it, it again deepens, and assumes its form.&nbsp; As it
approaches the Ceiriog river, which skirts the south side of the
park, it appears indeed a barrier.&nbsp; I took the depth a
little from the farm or wood yard, and found it about fifty feet,
a little farther on sixty feet, and near its termination at Pont
Melin y Castell, or the Castle Mill, it is about eighty
feet.&nbsp; At this point there is a bridge over the river, up
whose banks, at about half a mile distance, is a farm still
retaining the name of Crogen Isaf, or Lower Crogen.</p>
<p>In the bank of limestone rock below the bridge, and on the
side of the river, is a cavern or subterraneous passage, of
unknown extent, and which I <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>have not had opportunity to
explore.&nbsp; Above Crogen Isaf, and near a bridge of very
capacious span across the Ceiriog, called Pont Madoc, a powder
mill was about to be erected; but when the work was nearly
completed, the projector became unable to proceed, and it was
discontinued.</p>
<p>Thinking it best not to break the narrative of my progress
along the ancient Dyke, by which I passed so near to the
venerable Castle of Chirk, I have hitherto purposely omitted an
account of that celebrated mansion.&nbsp; I shall now, however,
return to it.</p>
<h2>Chirk Castle.</h2>
<p>This noble and ancient pile was built on the site of Castell
Crogen, about the year 1011.&nbsp; I must here hazard a
conjecture concerning this <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Castle.&nbsp; I am of opinion that
the old Castle of Crogen was then enlarged and repaired, not
entirely rebuilt; as John Myddleton, who communicated a paper to
the Society of Antiquarians on the subject, says it was begun
A.D. 1011, and was finished in 1013, which makes it only about
two years, probably too short a period for the total re-erection
of so large an edifice.</p>
<p>The building is square, and is flanked by four massive
bastions or rounders, one at each corner.&nbsp; There is a fifth
in the centre of the front, of the same dimensions as the
others.&nbsp; The length of the front is about two hundred and
fifty feet; the square court or quadrangle within the walls is
about one hundred and sixty-five feet, by one hundred.&nbsp; The
grand entrance is under a lofty arched <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>gateway; the side entrance is by a
double flight of stone stairs, through a postern and colonnade,
into the quadrangle.&nbsp; I measured the walls of the north-west
bastion, and found them more than fourteen feet thick, and all
apparently of solid masonry.&nbsp; The whole of this extensive
and ponderous building is of hewn stone.</p>
<p>On the west side of the quadrangle is the door of the dungeon,
which in feudal times has been the melancholy abode of many
hapless victims, who fell under their Lord&rsquo;s
displeasure.&nbsp; There is at the entrance a case or hollow in
the thickness of the wall, for a portcullis; and there are two
places of confinement, one below the other.&nbsp; The first is
not formed so far below the surface of the earth as totally to
exclude the light of day; it being admitted obliquely from <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>above.&nbsp;
There is also a fire-place; so that it is probable this might be
a prison for less serious crimes, or for delinquents of noble
quality.&nbsp; The deep dungeon is far below the first, the
descent to it being by forty-two steps; and is said to be as deep
as the walls are high.&nbsp; It is small and circular, and about
twelve or fourteen yards in circumference.&nbsp; The iron doors
are now taken away, and one of oak is substituted, which bears
upon it numberless notches, not, like those of Sterne&rsquo;s
captive, made to mark the days of misery, but the number of horns
of strong ale drank at one sitting by a party assembled in this
place to drink to the health of the Lord of the Castle.&nbsp; It
is a record of the strength of their heads, if not of their
attachment to their Lord.&nbsp; High up in the wall are two iron
hooks, fixed to support a large <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>cheese, which was formerly kept here
for the entertainment of those who chose to visit this gloomy
place.&nbsp; The sides of the dungeon are partly formed of the
rock on which the Castle is founded, as is also the floor.</p>
<p>Returning to the light of the sun, on the adjoining south side
of the quadrangle is the servants&rsquo; hall, in which are
deposited various ancient and family relics.&nbsp; The walls are
hung round with boar spears, pikes, and halberts; arquebuses,
matchlocks, and other old fire-arms; saddles, spurs, and various
pieces of armour; enormous and curious spoils of the chace,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Among a variety of deer antlers, is the head of a stag, of
which the following curious story is told:&mdash;A young woman,
crossing the Black <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Park at the early dawn of morning, was assailed by this
furious animal.&nbsp; Her cries for assistance were heard by one
of the numerous retainers of the Castle, whose dwelling was nigh,
and he promptly ran to her aid.&nbsp; The stag, no way
intimidated, made fiercely at the man, and literally gored him to
death.&nbsp; The Black Park is now converted into an extensive
colliery.</p>
<p>Opposite to the servants&rsquo; hall is the main entrance into
the Castle from the quadrangle.&nbsp; In the large and lofty
entrance hall are some fine paintings, and a superb billiard
table.&nbsp; The grand stairs front the entrance, and lead to the
stately apartments of the Castle, which have been lately
renovated in a superior style of elegance by Mrs. Biddulph, the
present inheritor.&nbsp; A saloon, a gallery, and <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>a
drawing-room, in particular, are beautifully finished, and banish
from the mind the idea of a gloomy Castle, which its exterior
seems to promise.</p>
<p>The rooms are enriched with some good paintings; and in the
saloon are some finely executed portraits of the family.&nbsp; In
this room there is a cabinet of most exquisite workmanship.&nbsp;
The views from the different windows are inexpressibly beautiful,
and are said to embrace a prospect extending into seventeen
counties.</p>
<p>In the civil wars this Castle was besieged by Cromwell&rsquo;s
adherents, and one of its sides, with three of its towers,
overthrown.&nbsp; It is mentioned as a prodigious exertion of
labour, and in which no cost was spared, that the wing was
rebuilt in one year, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>at the expense of eighty thousand
pounds; which I think strengthens my idea of the present Castle
being only an enlargement and repair of the more ancient Castell
Crogen.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half from the Castle, stands the pleasant
little village of</p>
<h2>Chirk.</h2>
<p>It is an example of simple neatness and good taste.&nbsp; The
cottages are built in the Swiss style, with singular rustic
elegance, and have the appearance of comfort and quiet.&nbsp; The
inhabitants are mainly indebted for the beauty of their rustic
cottages to the Countess Dungannon of Brynkinallt, and for the
uniformity and useful convenience of water in every house, which
is conveyed by leaden pipes, to the exertions and influence <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of Mrs.
Myddelton Biddulph, the owner of the Castle, and the elder branch
of the much-respected family of the Myddeltons.&nbsp; She is Lady
of the Manor of Chirk, and has built and endowed a school for the
education of the village children.&nbsp; Her exertions to promote
the comfort and interest of her tenantry are worthy
imitation.</p>
<p>Near the church, and now enclosed in a garden, stands an
artificial mount, which Mr. Pennant conjectures to be coeval with
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke. <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; A similar one stood on the
opposite side, where now the road runs.&nbsp; These mounts were
probably Saxon stations, and curbs to the Welch, to prevent them
from violating the line of demarcation which Offa had formed.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>The
church is a capacious old structure, dedicated to St. Mary, and
was formerly an impropriation belonging to the Abbey of Valle
Crucis.&nbsp; It has a tower steeple, containing six bells.&nbsp;
All the east side of the church wall within is nearly covered
with marble monuments of the Chirk Castle family.&nbsp; A bust of
Sir Thomas Myddelton, and another of his Lady, are well
executed.&nbsp; There are also many other remarkable <i>memento
mori&rsquo;s</i> within the church, well worth the attention of
those who love to muse on</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Names once famed, now dubious or forgot,<br
/>
And buried midst the wreck of things which were.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe there are not standing within the same compass of
ground in the kingdom of Great Britain, three mansions so
eminently deserving admiration for magnificence, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>grandeur, and
beauty, as Wynnstay, Chirk Castle, and Brynkinallt; the latter of
which I shall now proceed to describe.</p>
<h2>Brynkinallt</h2>
<p>Is about one mile from the village of Chirk, and is the
ancient seat of the noble family of the Trevors, as I find in an
authentic genealogical table, of which the following is a short
extract:&mdash;&ldquo;In the reign of King Richard II. there was
a noble peer, by name Geofry Lord Trevor, and also John Trevor,
Bishop of St. Asaph, and Chancellor of Chester.&nbsp; He
continued in the bishoprick to the sixth year of King Henry
IV.&nbsp; And in the reign of King Henry VI. (1421) lived two
brothers descended of this honourable family, namely, John and
Richard.&nbsp; John, the eldest brother, was seated at
Brynkinallt.&nbsp; He married Agnes, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>daughter and heiress of Peter
Chambre, of Pool, Esq. by whom he had issue five sons, who laid
the foundation of many noble branches.&nbsp; Robert, the eldest,
succeeded his father at Brynkinallt.&nbsp; He married Catherine,
daughter and heiress of Llewellen Ap Howel De Mould, and had
issue.&nbsp; From Edward, the second son, by Amy, daughter of
James Ryffin, Esq. descended Mark Trevor, from whom descended the
Viscount Dungannon in Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; From him the nobleman
who at present inherits the title, and the residence of
Brynkinallt, is a lineal descendant; and under his auspices,
aided by the exquisite taste of his Countess, this superb edifice
has attained the acme of beauty.</p>
<p>To rush at once into this charming labyrinth of delight would
fill the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>mind with confusion; and the beholder would be at a loss
in what direction to commence his observations, where every part
claims his admiration.&nbsp; I therefore beg my readers will
accompany me about two miles on the Oswestry road, to Bryn y
Gwyla Lodge, a beautiful triumphal arch-like entrance into Bryn y
Gwyla Park, through which a new road is now forming to
Brynkinallt.&nbsp; This part of the domain is in Shropshire; the
interesting stream of the Ceriog dividing Shropshire from
Denbighshire at this place.</p>
<p>As you proceed towards the river, whose sides are charmingly
clothed with forest trees, and whose banks are fringed with
shrubs to the water edge, the eye is caught by some of the
pinnacles of Brynkinallt, and by the blue smoke arising from the
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>mansion,
which seems playfully to linger among the lofty summits of the
luxuriant trees that adorn it.&nbsp; Proceeding on the highest
road, called the Green Drive, which runs along the top of the
Hanging Wood, whose majestic and venerable timber seems to
continue the luxuriant line of wavy branches to the very mansion,
through one of the natural vistas which here and there present
themselves, Brynkinallt bursts upon the sight in all its beauty,
embosomed in the softened and variously tinted foliage of the
plantations which surround it.&nbsp; From this spot the most
interesting and picturesque view of the place is obtained; and I
believe it is the point from whence an artist of some celebrity
has designed a picture of the mansion.</p>
<p>At the termination of this drive <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the murmuring Ceriog is crossed by an
ornamental stone bridge, at the foot of which, on the bank of the
river, stands a simple rustic cottage, richly clothed with ivy,
and formed of unhewn pebble stones.&nbsp; At this lodge is kept a
key of the bridge gate; and a bell attached to the gate procures
attendance.&nbsp; Crossing the bridge into Denbighshire, the
elegant taste of the inheritor of the place begins to display
itself.&nbsp; New beauties appear at every step, as you approach
the house; pheasants feed in numbers on the smooth verdant lawn
before the windows, and seem to give an earnest of the quiet and
security of the domain.</p>
<p>This beautiful place is thus mentioned by Mr.
Pennant:&mdash;&ldquo;From Chirk (he says) I made an excursion to
Brynkinallt, about a mile below <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the village: this had been the seat
of the Trevors.&nbsp; The house is of brick, built in
1619.&rdquo; <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; Nor can I find more attention
bestowed on this charming place by any of the numerous tourists
who have given an account of their excursions to the public; and
I am at a loss to account why this, the most unique and beautiful
spot in the neighbourhood, should thus long have escaped
attention.</p>
<p>The house is undoubtedly the work of Inigo Jones, and was
built on the site of a former mansion of brick, either in the
latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, or early in the
reign of James I.&nbsp; The additions made by the present worthy
possessor are ornamental and useful, and are formed so
judiciously, and so strictly <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>in character with the old part, as
not to be distinguished from the original design.&nbsp; I should
call the style demi-gothic; it is now cased over with mastic or
Roman cement, and has all the appearance of well hewn stone; and
some think it will have equal durability.</p>
<p>The house is formed with a noble mansion-like centre,
decorated with minarets and pinnacles, and flanked by two low
retiring wings, making altogether a very beautiful and ornamental
front.&nbsp; The grand entrance is through a conservatory and
viranda, elegantly decorated with choice flowers and exotic
plants.&nbsp; Over the inner entrance door are the arms of the
Marquis of Wellesley, Viceroy of Ireland, emblazoned upon glass,
occupying the whole width of the doorway, and bearing an
inscription, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>likewise painted on the glass, signifying that the
Marquis presented this painted glass as a mark of his esteem to
his dear friend and relation, Lord Viscount Dungannon.&nbsp; The
execution is good, and does great credit to the Irish artist.</p>
<p>Advancing a few steps into the interior, the eye is arrested
by the brilliancy of the scene which breaks upon the sight.&nbsp;
Immediately in front, through the spacious hall, is a grand
flight of stairs, terminated by a richly stained glass window,
and leading to a gallery that surrounds the hall, and which is
decorated with the busts of much distinguished and eminent
persons, as the King, the Duke of York, the Duke of Wellington,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Up the passage to the left hand, the view is
bounded by the superb dining room; and on the right it terminates
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>in a
charming conservatory, through which is a way to the pleasure
grounds and gardens.&nbsp; From the dining room on the extreme
left, to the conservatory on the right, it is about one hundred
and sixty feet.</p>
<p>To particularize or to give an adequate idea of the superb and
very tasteful decorations of every room in this elegant mansion
is far beyond my power of description; and therefore I dare not
make the attempt.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that every nook seems
decorated by the hand of taste, guided by the most correct
judgment; all is elegantly superb, and chastely grand.&nbsp; In
some of the windows is much old painted glass, particularly in
the library, where there are some very excellent specimens.</p>
<p>Here is also a valuable collection <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of china; and in one of the rooms are
some beautiful vases of that fragile material.</p>
<p>The mansion is adorned throughout with valuable pictures by
the old masters, some of which his Lordship selected in
Italy.&nbsp; There is a landscape near the fire-place, in the
same room where the china vases stand, painted by Claude
Lorraine, which is a most beautiful production of that great
master.&nbsp; In short,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whatever in this worldly state<br />
Is sweet and pleasing unto living sense,<br />
Or that may daintiest fantasie aggrate,<br />
Is poured forth with plentiful dispense,<br />
And made there to abound with lavish affluence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Spencer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beauty and elegance abounding in this place must be seen
to be justly appreciated; and the urbanity and gentlemanly
condescension of the noble owner, in affording me the <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>means of
gratifying my inquiries and curiosity, will never be effaced from
my memory.</p>
<p>In the adjoining shrubbery is an ornamental building called
the china room, fitted up (it would be superfluous to say
elegantly) by Lady Dungannon.&nbsp; Within the room are deposited
the most valuable and beautiful specimens of old china.&nbsp; The
walls are covered with plates, dishes, &amp;c. in many various
figures and forms.&nbsp; There is a fire-place in the room, and a
small portable collection of books for the amusement of a passing
hour.&nbsp; In a room adjoining is an assemblage of
cream-coloured pottery, in its greatest variety; and behind all,
is a cool, well arranged dairy.</p>
<p>To some, and to ladies in particular, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the
examination of the china room will afford the highest
gratification.&nbsp; For myself, I must confess, the exquisite
specimens of art I had just been viewing in the mansion so
entirely engrossed my mind, that I could not look on these later
morceaus with the attention they merited.</p>
<p>I have before stated that the river Ceriog runs through part
of the domain; and it is made to contribute much to its
beauty.&nbsp; It passes through a deep and thickly wooded dingle,
and a rural and shady walk winds along the glen to another
entrance lodge, about half a mile from Chirk.&nbsp; The way is
enlivened by game springing before you at every step, and rousing
the attention from that soothing melancholy which the umbrageous
solemnity of the walk is calculated to inspire.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>There
are four lodges, or gates of entrance into the domain, inhabited
by some of his Lordship&rsquo;s dependents.&nbsp; They are all
built in an ornamental and romantic style; but about them, though
so varied in design, there are no disjointed or distorted
features to offend the most fastidious.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And that which all fair work doth much
aggrace,<br />
The art which wrought it all appeareth in no place.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Spencer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brynkinallt, as well as Chirk, is on the English side of
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, to which I shall now return on my way to the
Berwyn Mountains; observing by the bye, that although this part
of the country is called Wales, yet that Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, made
in the year 776, cut it off from the Principality, and John of
Salisbury, in his Polycraticon, writeth thus:&mdash;<a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>&ldquo;Harold
ordained a law, that what Welchman soever should be found with a
weapon on this side the limit which he had set them (that is to
say, Offa&rsquo;s Dyke), he should have his right hand cut off by
the King&rsquo;s officers.&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; So, as Harold
II. reigned nearly three hundred years after the Dyke was cut, it
is plain, by this law, that it continued to be considered the
line of demarcation at that time; and even to this day the bell
of vassalage, the curfew, is rung every night at Chirk, that is,
on the English side the Dyke; but is never heard at Llangollen,
which is on the Welch side.&nbsp; This goes far to prove that
William&rsquo;s English laws reached Chirk, and no farther.&nbsp;
Leaving the Dyke, I now return to the Berwyn Mountains.</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Berwyn
MOUNTAINS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Clouds rest on the hills: spirits fly, and
travellers fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are our chiefs of old?&nbsp; Where our Kings of
mighty name?&nbsp; The fields of their battle are silent: scarce
their mossy tombs remain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> towards Llangollen by the
old road near Chirk Castle, called Oswestry way, the Berwyn
Mountains begin to raise their lofty summits. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; These Mountains occupy the
eastern side of Merionethshire, and branch into the counties of
Denbigh and Montgomery.&nbsp; Their southern boundary is the
river Tannant; their <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>northern the Dee.&nbsp; Their length
from north to south is about sixteen miles; their breadth from
east to west varying from five to ten miles. <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; Their highest tops are Cader
Fronwen, or the Whitebreast, and Cader Ferwyn.&nbsp; On the
summit of the former a large quantity of stones, collected from a
distance, and brought here with much labour and difficulty, are
cast round a stone pillar, marking the burial-place of some
chief, whose very name is now forgotten.</p>
<p>These Mountains, as I have before said, form the southern side
of the vale of Llangollen; and forming a frontier barrier for
this part of North Wales, they have been the scene of many a
bloody contest, and on these hills the hardy sons of Cambria have
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>successfully opposed the encroaching armies of their
Saxon neighbours.&nbsp; I trust my readers will excuse me if I
relate one of the most interesting events of that kind which took
place on this part of the Berwyn Mountains, and within my
prescribed limits.</p>
<p>Henry II. King of England, being exasperated by the repeated
predatory incursions of the Welch, <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a> and by the advantage
they took of ravaging the English territories in his frequent
absence, and finding that no treaties could bind them, resolved
on his return from Normandy to lead an army against Wales; and
having assembled a strong body of veteran troops, selected from
all parts of his very extensive dominions in Normandy, Flanders,
Anjou, Gascoine, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>and England, <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a> and hearing of some
daring inroads made by the North Wales men, he early in the year
1165, put himself at the head of this chosen army, and set
forward for North Wales, resolving to destroy without mercy every
living thing he could meet with.&nbsp; Having advanced to Croes
Oswalt, now Oswestry, he encamped there, and sent forward a body
of men to try the passes of the Dyke and Ceriog, who being met
near Castell Crogen, as has been before stated, were there
defeated, and buried in the Dyke.</p>
<p>It is probable that the victorious Welchmen were a party
detached from the Welch army; for Owen Gwynedd, then Prince of
Wales, having heard of the great preparations made by the King,
had very prudently <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>confederated all the power of the country, and had
assembled his forces at Corwen, a very strong country in
Edernion, and there awaited the King&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; He
had with him, besides his brother Cadwalader, and all the power
of North Wales, Prince Rhys, with those of South Wales, Owen
Cyfeeliog and Madog Meredith, with the strength of Powis; in
short, all the forces the Welch could muster. <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a></p>
<p>The King, finding the Welch so strong, and knowing their
fickleness, stayed some time at Oswestry, in expectation that a
confederacy so hastily formed would as suddenly dissolve; but
finding them firm and determined in their adherence, and that his
enemies were so near, he became desirous to bring on an
engagement.&nbsp; <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>He therefore moved towards the Dyke with his whole army,
and pushed on a party to the Ceriog river, which washes the foot
of the Berwyn; giving orders that the banks should be cleared of
the woods, which at that time formed a complete jungle, to
prevent his troops falling into the ambuscade of the enemy.</p>
<p>It would seem the Welch had taken the precaution to guard the
passes of the river; for the King in person, in an attempt to get
possession of a bridge, experienced one of those hair-breadth
escapes which sometimes decide the fate of kingdoms: <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a>&mdash;A Welch archer, having marked the
personal exertions of the King, and fired with the hope of
freeing his country, chose a place of concealment, <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>from whence,
watching his opportunity, he discharged an arrow with such deadly
aim, that it must inevitably have slain the King, had not Hubert
De St. Clair, Constable of Colchester, who was in close
attendance, and whose name is deservedly recorded for his
devotion to his monarch, seeing the danger, rushed into the
course of the fatal shaft, and received it in his heart; thus
terminating his attachment with his life.</p>
<p>Whilst Henry was thus employing his forces in clearing the
banks of the Ceriog, a party of Welchmen, relying on their
knowledge of the country, and prompted by patriotic zeal,
attempted to surprise his vanguard, consisting chiefly of
pikemen, and the flower of the King&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; This
brought on a very bloody engagement, although not general, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>which cost
the lives of many brave men on both sides; but the attack having
been commenced without any preconcerted plan, and merely from a
sudden ebullition of desperate daring, Henry&rsquo;s veterans
were victorious, and making good the passage of the river,
advanced up the Berwyn.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the Welch Princes had advanced with their
army from Corwen, and had taken a strong position on the frontier
ridge.&nbsp; A fieldwork and entrenchment are still visible on
the Mountain, over Llangollen, and was probably the station of
part of the Welch forces, under Owen Gwynedd and his
allies.&nbsp; Henry, finding his formidable enemy thus
advantageously posted on the crown of the hill, did not deem it
prudent to attack him in this position, and therefore encamped
his <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>forces
on the lower part of the Mountain. <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>In this manner the two armies lay menacing each other; the
Welch carefully improving every opportunity of annoyance, and
from their lofty and advantageous situation watching every
movement of the King&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; Henry used every means
in his power to induce them to quit their camp, and attack him,
but in vain: while the Welch, by means of their irregular
adherents, cut off all supplies from the English, and reduced
them to the greatest straits and distress; added to which, the
rain now fell in torrents, and pouring down the sides of the
Mountain, rendered the English station so soft and slippery that
they were obliged to retreat, with great loss in men, horses, and
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>warlike
stores, leaving the Welch masters of the field.</p>
<p>The Welchmen, as might naturally be expected, exultingly
celebrated this triumph; while Henry, baffled and disgraced, and
with all his threats unperformed, gave way to rage, and added
savage cruelty to his disgrace.&nbsp; He at this time held as
hostages Rhys and Cadwallhon, the two sons of Owen Gwynedd; and
also Cynric and Meredith, the two sons of Rhys Ap Gryffydh, of
South Wales; as likewise the sons and daughters of other Welch
Lords. <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; In the savage fierceness of his
rage, he ordered the eyes of these innocent victims to be pulled
out, and the ears of the young gentlewomen to be stuffed.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>From
this digression, for which, as pointing out the places where
these historical facts happened, I hope my readers will pardon
me, I now return to the Oswestry old way, which runs near Chirk
Castle.</p>
<p>Not more than sixty years ago, this used to be the public high
road to Oswestry, although the capacious and excellent road which
now skirts the Mountains&rsquo; base would almost induce one to
think it impossible.&nbsp; A very respectable and old inhabitant
of Llangollen informs me, that before the road was altered and
improved, some of the family from Chirk Castle used to visit
Llangollen once a year in the family coach.&nbsp; On the
appointed day, which was generally known beforehand, all the
inhabitants were on the alert; and no sooner was the rumble of
the <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>ponderous wheels heard on the stones, than young and
old, sick and lame, poured out of their dwellings to see the
wonderful phenomenon; and during the few hours of its stay in the
town, it attracted as much attention as a show of wild beasts at
a country fair.&nbsp; On its return to the Castle, the young men
of the village contended for the honour of assisting it to get up
the hill again; and this was the only vehicle of the kind seen
once a year in Llangollen, where now the most splendid and
elegant carriages, from the gig to the state-coach, roll along,
amid these stupendous rocks and mountains, upon roads as smooth,
as level, and as good, as any in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Oswestry old way is not now much frequented, but it
continues from Chirk Castle along the top of <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
Mountain.&nbsp; Many roads intersect it, but the old road is very
distinguishable.&nbsp; By the side of the way, rise two copious
springs, called Ffynnon Arthur.</p>
<p>From the eminence the view is most extensively delightful, and
amply repays the trouble and fatigue of the walk up the
Mountain.&nbsp; The curious Aqueduct of Pontcysyllte forms a very
pleasing and prominent feature in the foreground of the
landscape.</p>
<p>As you approach the descent on the side of the hill, the stone
pedestal of a cross or pillar stands among the gorse on the left
hand side of the road, but the shaft is not to be found.&nbsp;
Trees, planted three in a clump, mark the road at short
distances, and lead to the cultivated and inhabited <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>part of the
declivity. <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a>&nbsp; Proceeding to the extreme foot
of the Mountain, on the junction of the Oswestry road stood,
until these few months, another stone pillar, or cross <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a>, called Croes y Beddau; and upon it
was rudely cut &ldquo;<i>Oswestry Way</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
inscription is of more recent execution than the pillar, although
it is also very antique.</p>
<p>I conjecture these stones were erected as land-marks, and
guides to the traveller.&nbsp; An ancient way from this point
proceeded to the river Dee, which was then crossed by a <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>wooden
bridge.&nbsp; On the north side of the river, nearly opposite the
place where the wooden bridge stood, was another similar pillar,
called Croes Gwen Hwyfr.&nbsp; It stood on the road to Wrexham,
and has been removed only a few years.&nbsp; From Croes Gwen
Hwyfr, an old road proceeds to Castell Dinas Bran, by the
Llanddyn, once the residence of the Owens of Porkington, but now
converted into a farm-house.&nbsp; Through that farm the road
passed in a zigzag direction to Castell Dinas Bran, and the old
road is still traceable, although in some places quite lost.</p>
<p>Before I attempt to give an account of the ancient castle, I
must beg my reader&rsquo;s attendance to the Aqueduct, which
claimed notice in the view from the top of the Berwyn
Mountains.</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>The
Aqueduct.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Telford, who o&rsquo;er the vale of
Cambrian Dee,<br />
Aloft in air, at giddy height upborne,<br />
Carried his navigable road, and hung<br />
High o&rsquo;er Menai&rsquo;s Straits the bending bridge:<br />
Structures of more ambitious enterprise<br />
Than minstrels, in the age of old romance,<br />
To their own Merlin&rsquo;s magic lore ascribed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Aqueduct of Pontcysylte is so
called from a bridge of three arches over the river Dee, and
situated a little higher up the river.&nbsp; This is the most
stupendous work of the kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; It was designed
and executed by and under the inspection of that British
Archimedes, Mr. Thomas Telford, to carry a stream of water for
the supply of the Ellesmere Canal; to the proprietors of which,
in the year 1804, Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart. in the most liberal
manner made an important <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>donation of the waters of Bala pool,
as far as wanted; and to obtain that essential advantage the
Aqueduct was projected. <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; The level of
the canal is taken at a place in the river a little below the
church of Lantysilto, and about two miles on the west of
Llangollen.</p>
<p>The bank of the canal forms a charming promenade of about six
miles from its junction with the Dee to the Aqueduct, abounding
with interesting and picturesque scenery.&nbsp; Here and there
snug little white cottages, peeping from among the surrounding
trees, decorate and embellish the sides and recesses of some of
the eminences; while the tops are dotted with the little mountain
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>sheep,
scarcely distinguishable from the white stones that are scattered
upon their summits.&nbsp; The banks of the canal are ornamented
with trees, and embellished with bridges, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This Aqueduct, the most extraordinary structure of its kind in
the world, was begun on the twenty-fifth day of July, 1795, and
was finished on the twenty-sixth day of November, 1805; having
been ten years and five months in building.&nbsp; It is one
thousand and seven feet in length, and one hundred and twenty-six
feet eight inches in height from the surface of the flat rock on
the south side of the river Dee, to the top of the iron side
plates of the water way; and there are nineteen arches of
forty-five feet span each.&nbsp; The piers, eighteen <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>in number,
are constructed of square masonry, and the arches and water way
are composed of cast-iron.</p>
<p>At the south end of the Aqueduct there is an embankment of
earth, fifteen hundred feet in length, and seventy-five feet
high.&nbsp; The water way is eleven feet ten inches broad, and
five feet three inches deep.&nbsp; There is a broad towing-path
on the east side, guarded by a strong iron palisade, running the
whole length of the Aqueduct; from the north end of which the
canal is continued for a distance of about three hundred yards,
and there terminates in an extensive basin, which affords a
double wharfage, with iron railways.</p>
<p>I have heard of only one fatal accident occurring during the
progress of this arduous undertaking; <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>when a poor labourer employed on the
work fell from the top of one of the piers, and was dashed to
pieces on the rock below.&nbsp; His suffering was of short
duration, as the tremendous height from which he fell caused
instant dissolution.</p>
<p>The Aqueduct crosses the entrance of the vale of Llangollen
from north to south, and the walks under and about it are really
charming.&nbsp; The view along the beautiful vale of the Dee from
the top, in the centre of the towing-path, is delightful, and to
look down tremendous; and the river,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That on the unnumber&rsquo;d pebbles idly
chafes,<br />
Cannot be heard so high.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it requires a steady head, and a stout heart, to walk
over the Aqueduct, especially when the wind is high.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>On the
twenty-sixth day of November, 1805, the canal was opened in the
following manner, as described by one of the acting
Committee.&nbsp; He says&mdash;<a name="citation67"></a><a
href="#footnote67" class="citation">[67]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In going over the Aqueduct and returning,
the sensations varied.&nbsp; As the procession of boats advanced
towards the noble structure now first commencing its public
utility, the complete sense of security in which we floated one
hundred and twenty-six feet above the river Dee, and a just
acknowledgment to Mr. Telford, to whom it was deservedly a proud
day, and who had most happily arranged the whole of our
accommodation, as well as constructed the wonderful edifice that
supported us, naturally united.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;On our arrival at the eastern bank, we entered
the canal port.&nbsp; Lady Bridgewater, the ladies of Colonel
Kynaston Powell, and William Lloyd Ashton, Esq. and some others,
as connected with the Committee, now attended Lady Eleanor
Butler, Lady W. W. Wynn and her family, the Hon. Miss Ponsonby,
Miss Ormsby, and many other respectable visitors, to a repast
which had been provided; soon after which an Oration was
delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a signal being given, the cannon, which had been
advantageously posted on the platform below the rocks, and nearly
on a level with the Aqueduct, fired a royal salute.&nbsp; The
guns were manned by the Artillery Company, and were some of those
brought from the capture of Seringapatam, <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>now belonging
to the Shropshire Volunteers, whose skill and martial appearance
added much to the brilliancy of the day: they saluted the
Committee on their passage and return with fifteen rounds
each.&nbsp; After the repast and Oration, the whole company
prepared to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procession of boats was as follows:&mdash;In the
first and second boats, the Committee; in the third, the band of
the Shropshire Volunteers, in full uniform; the fourth was
occupied by the engineers, the occupiers of mines and founderies,
&amp;c. with their families.&nbsp; I was invited to take my
passage with them, having been engaged when the Committee set
out, and could from this boat, as a centre, better judge of the
whole.&nbsp; The fifth and sixth boats <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>closed the procession, gaily
ornamented with flags, and loaded with the first commercial
product of coal that had ever passed over the valley on this
noble bridge of union.&nbsp; The carriages, which conveyed the
rest of the company, formed a curved and continued line over the
bridge of the Dee (Pontcysyllte) and on both its banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evening was calm, and the favourite tunes of
&lsquo;<i>God save the King</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>Rule
Britannia</i>&rsquo; floated in the air, amongst the echoes of
the vale.&nbsp; Many (probably more than eight thousand) people
were stationed all around us, from the tops of the mountains to
the banks of the Dee, and were cheering and exulting, with
intervals of silent astonishment.&nbsp; All within sight or
hearing were expressing their sense of the general <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>happiness.&nbsp; The whole valley of Llangollen might be
said to laugh and sing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following inscription is on the Aqueduct upon the side of
the pier next to the south side of the river:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Returning from this stupendous work of human ingenuity
and exertion, towards the Castell Dinas Bran,</p>
<h2>Trevor Hall,</h2>
<p>A large brick mansion, presents itself.&nbsp; It is situated
on a rising ground, on the north side of the Wrexham road; and
was once the residence of John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph, who
in the year 1346 caused a stone bridge to be built over the Dee,
at Llangollen, which is accounted one of the wonders of
Wales.</p>
<p>Mr. Pennant says <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a> &ldquo;Trevor Hall
passed into the family of the Lloyds, and has continued in that
family to the present time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last possessor was a
lady of the name of <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Thomas, deceased in the last year, and leaving a son to
inherit, although at present he does not occupy the
premises.&nbsp; The house is roomy and substantial, and is
pleasantly situated; but has no pretensions to elegance or
beauty.&nbsp; Near the house is a church, or rather chapel, of
ease, enjoying Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, in which English
service is performed on the first Sunday in every month.</p>
<p>In a rocky cliff in the neighbourhood of the Hall, is a cavern
of some extent, in which I was informed there were to be found
the petrified bones of wolves, foxes, and other wild
animals.&nbsp; Resolving to ascertain the fact, I explored the
place, but, whatever there may have been, I could not discover
the vestiges of any such relics.&nbsp; I brought away some
specimens of stalactites, of <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>curious forms and various
incrustations, with which the roof of the cavern abounds, and
which may by some have been mistaken for petrified bony
substances.&nbsp; This craggy ridge seems to be the commencement
of that wonderful range of limestone called the Eglwyseg
Rocks.</p>
<p>Near to the river is the ancient house of Plas yn Pentre, now
inhabited by Mr. Edward Jones; and between Trevor Hall and the
Dee is one of the most beautifully clear springs of cold water
imaginable.&nbsp; It is called Ffynnon Yryrog, and is in very
great repute as a bath for the cure of rheumatic affections; and
if Saint Collen with a long name <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a> had thought proper
to have bestowed his benediction, it might perhaps have <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>rivalled its
prototype at Holywell.&nbsp; Its issue is very abundant, and its
coldness exceeds belief: persons bathing cannot continue in the
water a minute.&nbsp; Many wonderful accounts are told of its
efficacy in chronic disorders.&nbsp; In its passage to the Dee,
it formerly turned a water mill, now in ruins.&nbsp; The spring
rises in a field belonging to Plas yn Pentre.</p>
<p>On the road side, between Trevor Hall and Bron Heulog, is a
small farm house, called Plas Eva or Evan.&nbsp; I notice it only
as marking the spot where formerly was a cemetery, retaining the
appellation of Mynwent y Quacer, or Quaker&rsquo;s Burying
Ground.&nbsp; It is on the south side of the house; and in
cutting the canal, the earth from the excavation was thrown upon
the old graves and the inscribed stones that lay upon the
surface.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Opposite the north side of the same house, a few years
ago, as some labourers were working in the limestone rock, they
discovered a pot, filled with gold coin.&nbsp; The men, afraid of
losing their booty, kept the affair secret, and deputed one of
their party to dispose of the treasure at Chester, as old
gold.&nbsp; A rumour of the circumstance having got afloat, an
inquiry was instituted; but the secret was so well kept on all
hands, that only one piece, which a labourer had kept as a
curiosity, with a part of the earthen vessel that contained them,
were recovered, both of which I am informed are now in the
possession of Lady Clive.&nbsp; The name, date, or nominal value
of the coin, I cannot ascertain; but a person who saw one of the
pieces describes it as being about the size of a half crown, and
very thin, with an impression on each side.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>About a
mile nearer to the Castle, stands a recently erected mansion,
called Bron Heulog.&nbsp; It is only remarkable for the
narrowness of its windows and the nakedness of its
appearance.&nbsp; Nearing the town on the bank of the river,</p>
<h2>The Vicarage,</h2>
<p>A neat pretty edifice, claims notice.&nbsp; It was built a few
years ago, under the direction of the present vicar, the Rev. R.
W. Eyton, who resides here, and is in the commission of the
peace.&nbsp; In both capacities he does honour to the country in
which he lives, as an able conscientious minister, and an
impartial and upright magistrate.</p>
<p>Having thus given an account of some of the most remarkable
features of the country within my limits on <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the north
side of the river, and on the east end of the town, I beg my
readers to cross the river with me to Pengwern Hall, situated on
the south of the Dee, with which I shall conclude my account of
residences on the east of the town, as it is not in my plan to
notice the many pretty snug and pleasant looking retreats with
which the delightful landscape is studded, the beauty and comfort
of which the traveller of taste will not fail fully to
appreciate.&nbsp; Nor have I much to say of</p>
<h2>Llys Pengwern;</h2>
<p>For mouldering time hath swept away much of its grandeur and
its form.</p>
<p>Llys, i.e. Palace or Prince&rsquo;s Court, of Pengwern, is
situated at the foot of Pen y Coed, a tumulus-like hill on the
east side of Llangollen, in a well <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>cultivated and fruitful valley,
formed between, or rather of, the bases of Pen y Coed, and the
Berwyn.&nbsp; Little remains of the old house.&nbsp; There are
two vaulted rooms (the use of which I cannot conjecture) standing
at the end of the present house; and they are, I think, part of
the old palace.&nbsp; The roofs are formed with nine stone ribs,
which support a stone floor; for the rooms are one above the
other, and the little light admitted is through narrow loop-hole
windows.&nbsp; There is no vault or cellar beneath them.&nbsp;
The site is extensive, and many old pointed gothic windows appear
about the dilapidated walls.</p>
<p>The place is now in the occupation of a very respectable
farmer.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart. is the proprietor, in
whose family it has been a great many years.&nbsp; I find that <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>&ldquo;Tudor
Trevor, <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a> who in the British genealogies is
reckoned to be lineally descended from Vortigern, that
unfortunate King of the Britons, who first invited the Saxons
over into his country, married Gwladdis (some call her Angharad),
daughter of Howell Dda, King of all Wales, by whom he had issue
three sons; from the eldest of whom, Llwydocca, this family of
Mostyn is descended in a direct male line.&nbsp; Tudor Trevor
lived about A.D. 924, and his usual residence was at Llys
Pengwern, in Chirkland, in Denbighshire; which site, and lands
about it (though the house has been long destroyed), is in the
possesion of the family to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a stone which seems to have <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>belonged to
the old Llys, wrought up in the door-way, with an inscription
which I cannot decipher.&nbsp; The design seems a rude figure of
a sword, with an obtuse point, and the letters cut in relief on
the blade.&nbsp; They are many of them unlike the characters I
have seen, although some of them bear a strong resemblance to the
Roman, and some few to the Saxon.&nbsp; The hilt of the sword, on
which was the beginning of the inscription, is wanting.&nbsp;
This is the only inscribed stone I could discover on the
premises, although I was civilly assisted in my researches by the
occupier of the house.&nbsp; From the appearance of many of the
windows, &amp;c. I should almost suppose it the remains of a
religious sanctuary.</p>
<p>Returning to the north side of the Dee, I must notice a small
factory, <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>where cotton is spun and manufactured into cloth by
machinery.&nbsp; It was erected by a Mr. Turner.&nbsp; The main
wheel is worked by a partial diversion of the river.&nbsp; It has
also a claim upon the Ellesmere Canal for a supply of water, and
affords employment for many of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The builder
and his partner unfortunately proving insolvent, the concern was
for a while stopped, and the factory stood unoccupied about five
years.&nbsp; It is now carried on by a very respectable firm from
Manchester, and is a great benefit to the town.&nbsp; The factory
was destroyed by fire in 1814, but being fully insured it was
soon rebuilt.&nbsp; By means of an outlet from the mill dam, a
great quantity of fine trout and salmon are caught here in the
season.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to give some <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>account of Castell Dinas Bran, to
which I had before conducted my readers by the ancient road from
the Berwyn Mountains and Castell Crogen, or Chirk Castle.</p>
<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Castell<br />
DINAS BRAN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Desolate is the dwelling of Morna: silence
is in the house of her fathers.&nbsp; The voice of the people is
heard no more.&nbsp; The stream of Cultha is removed from its
place by the fall of its walls.&nbsp; Raise the song of mourning,
O bards!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Castell Dinas Bran, vulgarly
called Crow Castle, is one of the primitive Welch Castles.&nbsp;
I shall not bewilder myself or my readers, by seeking for the
origin of its name, which so many learned men have sought in
vain; all their researches ending in conjecture: nor can I find
any account to be relied upon, when or by whom it was
erected.</p>
<p>The Castle stands, as hath before been shown, immediately
above and <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>on the north side of Llangollen, on a conical mountain,
about six hundred yards above the level of the river Dee; <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a> and is built on the summit of the hill,
which probably was leveled to procure materials, as the building
occupies the whole flat.&nbsp; It seems to have been about one
hundred yards in length, by fifty yards wide.&nbsp; The present
remains are almost without form: they are built of the silicious
stone of the mountain, set in a coarse mortar or grout, which is
grown as hard as the stone itself.&nbsp; There are here and there
scattered remains of hewn stone for facings, &amp;c. some
vestiges of a small round tower and a vaulted passage, and also a
very limpid stream, now almost choked with ruins.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>A room
has been built within these few years, for the shelter and
convenience of visitors to the Castle; the key of which may be
obtained at a little white cottage half way up the hill,
inhabited by a very civil woman of the name of Parry, who
conducts the visitants, and provides them with tea if
required.</p>
<p>The Castle is conjectured to have been built by the Britons
before the Roman invasion; and was probably the residence of
Eliseg in the year 600. <a name="citation86"></a><a
href="#footnote86" class="citation">[86]</a>&nbsp; In the absence
of all authentic accounts, I present my readers with a free
translation of what I conceive to be a legendary tale, hoping it
will at least amuse.</p>
<p>I find in the fragment of an old <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Welch book (from which the title-page
is lost), obligingly lent to me by Mr. Edward Morris, of Rhiscog,
to whom I am indebted for much valuable information, the
following account of the building of Castell Dinas
Bran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Duke of Difnal, or Cornwall, having
conquered all his enemies, was crowned King, and reigned in peace
forty years, leaving at his death his kingdom to his two sons,
who were twins; Beli was the firstborn, Bran was the
youngest.&nbsp; They began to reign Anno Mundi 3600, but
contentions soon arising between them, they appealed to arms, and
called their friends and adherents to the field; and,
notwithstanding the persuasions and remonstrances of the chiefs
and great men of the <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>country, a day was appointed for the
decision of their claims by arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, their mother, the old Queen Corwena,
obtained an interview with her sons in her own apartments; when,
placing herself between them, she fell on her knees, her grey
hair disheveled, and her bosom bare, and thus addressed
them:&mdash;&lsquo;O! my dear sons, look on your mother, and for
her sake forbear to shed the blood of your friends; remember, it
is the Queen who solicits you to peace and unity; and remember
also that the blood of those brave men who fall in this quarrel
will cry for vengeance, and a life for a life, and a tooth for a
tooth, will be required.&nbsp; Consider, you once lived together
in peace upon this bosom, and now this great <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>kingdom is
too small for you.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, and as you value
my blessing, cast away this fierce wrath; be not more cruel than
the wolves of your forests, and the bears of your woods.&nbsp;
See how my tears fall upon those breasts where you were wont to
be cherished together.&nbsp; Do not let me go to my dark house in
sorrow.&nbsp; Throw down your arms, and embrace each other as
brothers, that God may bless the end of your days with peace and
prosperity, and crown your wives and your children with comfort
and joy.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two brothers were so affected by this address from
their mother, that they both assisted to raise her from her
knees, and intreated her blessing.&nbsp; They then embraced, and
drinking to their mother and to each other, dismissed their
armies.&nbsp; Beli <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>went to New Troy, <a name="citation90a"></a><a
href="#footnote90a" class="citation">[90a]</a> and Bran took up
his residence at a strong fortress, which he had built near
Llan-collen, <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a> and called Dinas Bran, after his own
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen, returning to the portion of land which had
been given to her as a jointure, there built a small town, which
she named after herself, Corwen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following seems to be another version of the same story;
and as the Brut from which it is taken is by the learned
translator supposed to be the real Book of Gildas, <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a> I hope the antiquity and rarity of the
account <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>will be a sufficient excuse to my general
readers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beli and Bran were the sons of Dyfnwal, and
began to reign 667 years before Christ. <a
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; A violent struggle arose for the
sovereignty of the kingdom, which ended in it being divided
between them: however, in process of time, ambition again
prompted the two brothers to collect their respective forces, in
order to obtain supremacy; but when the two armies were about to
engage, their mother, the old Queen Torwen, or Tarevin, rushed
between the lines, and hastening to her son Bran, who had long
been absent from her, she tenderly embraced him, and with many
sighs and tears intreated him to be reconciled to his brother
Beli.&nbsp; <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Her intreaties so wrought upon Bran that he turned all
his thoughts to peace, and laying aside his helmet, he went
unarmed to meet his brother.&nbsp; A reconciliation then took
place, the forces on each side throwing down their arms, and
approving the peace; and both parties went together to London, at
that time called Troia Newdd.&rdquo; <a name="citation92"></a><a

<p>As Eliseg&rsquo;s Pillar has given a name to a fertile valley,
to a township, and to the wonderful and stupendous Egwlseg Rocks,
and which they all retain to this day, I presume to ask, is it
not as reasonable to suppose, since we find it recorded that
there was a British King of the name of Bran, that the name of
the Castle I <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>am describing should have been derived from him, rather
than from a paltry stream bearing the name of Bran, or from an
insignificant bird; for Bran in the Welch language signifies
Crow.&nbsp; Might not, also, the streamlet of the Bran take its
name from the city of Bran? for I find in Richards&rsquo;s Welch
Dictionary, &ldquo;<i>Dinas</i>,&rdquo; English
&ldquo;<i>City</i>;&rdquo; therefore, &ldquo;<i>Castell Dinas
Bran</i>,&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;<i>The Castle of the City of
Bran</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Din</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>a fortified
city or mount</i>,&rdquo; as Dinbrin, which adjoins the Castle
Hill.&nbsp; Should these hints, which with all deference I
venture to suggest, invite others to a deeper and more successful
research, I shall be happy; and I sincerely wish some one may
prosecute further inquiry, furnished with more ample materials,
and endowed with a superior degree of antiquarian knowledge.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Leaving
apocryphal accounts, I find that Madog Ap Gryffydd Maelor, who
founded the Abbey Crucis A.D. 1200, and who was by his
mother&rsquo;s side the grandson of Gwen Gwynedd, Prince of North
Wales, resided at Castell Dinas Bran. <a
name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a>&nbsp; He inherited Powis Madoc, and
was Lord of the second Bromfeild and Mochnant Is Rhauader. <a
name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a></p>
<p>In the year 1209, Madog, forgetting his duty to his country
and to his prince, led his vassals and adherents to join the
English army under King John, then lying at Oswestry <a
name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c"
class="citation">[94c]</a> (Wynne says at Chester <a
name="citation94d"></a><a href="#footnote94d"
class="citation">[94d]</a>); where he had assembled a great
force, and with his usual violence and passion had resolved to
execute the severest <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>vengeance on the inhabitants of North
Wales, and not to suffer a person to remain alive in the
country.&nbsp; But such resolves are sooner made than executed;
and Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, no sooner heard of these mighty
preparations, and of the disaffection of some of his own
countrymen, particularly of the Lord of Dinas Bran, than he
issued his orders to his subjects in the counties of Denbigh and
Flint, to remove all their cattle and moveable substance for a
season, to the mountains of Snowdon; by which means, and by
getting into the rear of the King&rsquo;s army, now advanced as
far as the Castle of Teganwy, he so straitened and harassed the
English forces, that, after eating their horses, and being
reduced to the greatest extremity, they were obliged to retrace
their steps at that time in disgrace, and <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>breathing
revenge, which the King in some measure executed the next year.
<a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; But as I mean to confine myself
to the history of the Lords of Dinas Bran, I will not deviate
from my plan, by noticing matter which may be deemed
extraneous.</p>
<p>When John by his maladministration had quarrelled with his
great Barons, and thrown England into confusion, the vaccillating
Madog, Lord of Dinas Bran, again swore fealty to his lawful
Prince, Llewellyn, who politically overlooked his disaffection,
and accepted his submission.&nbsp; This and some other accession
of force enabled the Welch Prince successfully to assail the
English, from whom he took all the castles the King had
garrisoned, and most <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>cruelly and unjustly put to death all
their defenders in cold blood.&nbsp; This happened A.D. 1213. <a
name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"
class="citation">[97a]</a>&nbsp; The remainder of the time of
this factious man, Madog, was occupied in rapine, war, and
slaughter; and he closed his turbulent life in Castell Dinas
Bran, and was buried at his Abbey of Llan Egwest, or Valle
Crucis, A.D. 1236, <a name="citation97b"></a><a
href="#footnote97b" class="citation">[97b]</a> leaving his son
Lord of Powis Fadog, Lord of Dinas Bran, and all his other
signiorities.</p>
<p>Gryffydd Ap Madog, like his father, partook of the character
of the times, and was fickle and turbulent.&nbsp; His father,
Madog Ap Gryffydd Maelor, had generally resided at Wattstay, now
Wynnstay; but Gryffydd Ap Madog made the <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Castell Dinas
Bran his chief residence, and it is probable that his confidence
in this almost inaccessible retreat might strengthen and
encourage him in his waywardness.</p>
<p>I find him joining Prince Edward, the son of Henry III. then
King of England, with all his forces, in the year 1257; and his
disaffection is thus stigmatized by the old writers: <a
name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a"
class="citation">[98a]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;But Gryffydd Ap Madog
Maelor, Lord of Dinas Bran, a person of notorious reputation for
injustice and oppression, basely forsook the Welch, his
countrymen, and with all his forces went over to the Earl of
Chester.&rdquo; <a name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a></p>
<p>The following year, Llewellyn the <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Prince, returning from an expedition
into South Wales, met the Earl, and forced him to retreat with
great precipitation, leaving the possessions of his unnatural
allies at the mercy of the conqueror, who now resolved to be
revenged on that ungrateful fugitive, the Lord of Dinas
Bran.&nbsp; He therefore passed through Bromfeild, and miserably
laid waste the whole country, and obliged Gryffydd to keep close
in his Castle of Dinas Bran, which, being situated on the summit
of a very steep hill, seemed impregnable to all the daring
efforts that could be used against it. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></p>
<p>King Henry, being now much incensed against the Welch Prince
Llewellyn, on account of the obstinate resistance he experienced,
and <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>having drawn together the whole strength of England,
even from St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, in Cornwall, to the river
Tweed, marched with his son Edward in great rage to North Wales,
and without any opposition advanced as far as Teganwy; but
Llewellyn having taken precaution, as was the practice of the
Welch in cases of invasion, to have all manner of provision and
forage carried over the river, and having secured the strait and
narrow passages whereby the English might advance into the
country, the King&rsquo;s troops were in a short time so mortally
harassed and fatigued, that they were obliged to return to
England in haste, and with great loss.</p>
<p>Gryffydd Ap Madog, finding King Henry unable to protect his
estate, submitted to his rightful Prince; <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>and
Llewellyn then passed to Powis, and banished Gryffydd Ap
Gwenwynwyn, who had also joined the English, and took all the
lands in the country of Powis into his own hands.</p>
<p>Llewellyn, who was a politic prince, received the submission
of the Lord of Dinas Bran, because he knew that inaccessible
fortress could not be forced from him, and that it would not be
safe to have an avowed enemy, with so strong a refuge for his
disaffected subjects, in the rear of his operations; otherwise
Gryffydd Ap Madog had merited banishment as much as his namesake
of Powisland: nay, Gryffydd, Lord of Dinas Bran, married an
English lady, <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a> Emma, daughter of Lord Audley, whose
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>father
did much mischief and hurt to the Welch, by bringing from Germany
a body of horsemen, who, by the uncommon size of their horses,
and their unusual manner of fighting, terrified and easily
defeated the Welchmen at the first; but when they had become more
familiarized with their mode, they took their revenge upon them,
even on Lord Audley&rsquo;s own land. <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a></p>
<p>All the nobility of Wales had solemnly sworn to defend their
country till death against the invasion of the English, and not
to relinquish or forsake one another; and the return of Gryffydd
Ap Madog to his allegiance diffused through every breast the hope
of better days. <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>From
this time to the day of his death, I do not find that he again
deserted his Prince, but attached himself to the fortunes of his
country, although fears of the resentment of his countrymen for
his former conduct made him keep close to his Castle of Dinas
Bran, where he died in 1270, <a name="citation103a"></a><a
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a> and was buried
by the side of his father in the Abbey Church of Valle Crucis;
leaving his country in the enjoyment of freedom and peace; the
Welch having, by innate bravery and constancy, aided by the
fastnesses of their country, and the good policy of their Prince,
freed themselves for a time from the thraldom of their potent
enemy.</p>
<p>Mr. Pennant gives a different account of his end. <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a>&nbsp; He says that <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>&ldquo;his
wife, Emma, having alienated his affection from his own country,
made him an instrument of its subjection, and of the destruction
of his own family; for, as he took part with Henry III. and
Edward I. against his natural Prince, the resentment of his
countrymen was excited against him, and he was obliged to shelter
himself from their rage in his Castle of Dinas Bran, where
probably shame and grief put an end to his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Gryffydd Ap Madog, by his wife Emma,
daughter of John, Lord Audley, left issue four sons, viz. Madog,
Llewellyn, Gryffydd, and Owen. <a name="citation104"></a><a
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; Madog, the
eldest, became Lord of Dinas Bran &amp;c.&nbsp; He died, it is
supposed, not <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>long after his father, leaving two sons to inherit his
property. <a name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; The eldest, called Madog, had,
by his father&rsquo;s will, Bromfeild and Yale, the Castell Dinas
Bran, &amp;c.; the second son, Llewellyn, the Lordship of Chirk,
&amp;c.&nbsp; It should seem these children were not of age when
their father died; for Edward I. King of England, took on him to
appoint guardians to them both, and committed Madog, the elder,
to the care of John, Earl of Warren, one of his favorites; and
Llewellyn he intrusted to Roger Mortimer, son of Lord Mortimer,
of Wigmore. <a name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; These men well understood the
nature of the appointment; and it is probable that Edward had
maturely weighed in his mind the potency of <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>their
enmity, who could be such powerful friends, and having then but
recently subjugated the country, he might wish out of his way two
scions of a stock which had proved so stubborn and so
valiant.&nbsp; It was well known that Warren and Mortimer had rid
themselves of their respective charges, and had possessed
themselves of their estates, which they were suffered to enjoy
without an inquiry being instituted respecting them, or about the
disappearance of their wards; but the manner of the murder of
these two unfortunate children has but lately been discovered, in
a manuscript in the Bodleian Library. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; The guardian of the two boys
caused them to be drowned under Holt Bridge; and no doubt from
hence arose the <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>origin of a fable which was long current in the
country, of two fairies having been drowned in that place.</p>
<p>From the Earls of Warren the Castell Dinas Bran passed to the
Arundel <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> and other families.&nbsp; In 1390,
Myfanuy Fechan, a descendant of the house of Tudor, resided
there, and was celebrated for her beauty in a long ode by Howel
Ap Einion Lygliw, a celebrated bard of that time.&nbsp; The
Castle was probably then held under the Earls of Arundel.&nbsp;
It is now the property of Mrs. Myddelton Biddulph, of Chirk
Castle.&nbsp; The period of its destruction is as completely
unknown as the time of its foundation.&nbsp; Eagles and hawks in
abundance used to breed, <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>as some now do, in the neighbouring
rocky ridge of the Eglwyseg, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Along the narrow valley
you might see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild deer sporting on the
meadow ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here and there a solitary tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mossy stone, or rock with
woodbine crown&rsquo;d.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft did the cliffs reverberate the sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of parted fragments tumbling from

&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the summit of that craggy mound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perching eagle oft was heard
to cry,<br />
Or on resounding wing to shoot athwart the sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The view from the Castle is not so extensive as might be
expected from its elevation, being bounded, except towards the
east, by more lofty mountains; yet the scenery is most truly
grand and magnificent.&nbsp; According to the plan laid down in
the beginning of this work, I leave my readers to their own
observations; only informing them that the house which makes a
distinguished figure to the westward is Dinbrin Hall, the
residence of Richard Jones, Esq.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Descending on the west side of the hill, and proceeding
on the old way to the Abbey Crucis, stands a neat house, called
the Twr, i.e. Tower, which I conjecture, for I can obtain no
written document on the subject, to have been a look-out or
watch-tower belonging to the Castle; especially as it is placed
on the side most easy of access.&nbsp; Some additions have been
made to the Tower, and it is now a comfortable farm-house,
inhabited by a very respectable lady, of the name of Price.&nbsp;
It has been a square building, built of hewn stone, as evinced by
the massive walls which now surround the old part converted into
a parlour, and by an old spiral stone stair at the back of the
room.</p>
<p>The old way from the Castle to the Abbey has been much
intersected <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>and crossed, especially by the branch of the Ellesmere
Canal, and by roads made to recently erected retreats and farms;
among which I must not, however, reckon the road to</p>
<h2>Llantysilio,</h2>
<p>Which is a place of great antiquity.&nbsp; It belonged of old
time to the ancient family of the Cuppers of the North, <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a> so called even in the time of King
Henry II.; and by the marriage of a daughter of that family with
a Mr. Jones, of Llanbothian, in Montgomeryshire, it became the
heritage of the late possessor of that name, and is now inhabited
by Major Harrison, who resides in the Hall, a large brick
building, bearing <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>a strong affinity to Trevor Hall in antiquity of
erection.&nbsp; It is situated in a pleasant valley, watered by
the river Dee, over which it enjoys a fine prospect.</p>
<p>The Church of Llantysilio is dedicated to a Welch saint, from
whom the township takes its name.&nbsp; He was Prince of Powis,
and was called St. Tysilio.&nbsp; It is a neat little edifice,
with a very pleasant church-yard, and contains nothing very
ancient in the monumental way; but there are around it many very
venerable yew trees, with their wide spreading sombre
foliage.&nbsp; I had the curiosity to measure one, and found it
above twenty feet in girth.&nbsp; The inside of the Church is,
like its neighbour at Llangollen, indebted for some of its
decorations to the Abbey Crucis, which seems after its <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>dissolution
to have been considered as lawful plunder; and this circumstance
in some measure accounts for its so speedy dilapidation.&nbsp;
English service is performed in the Church of Llantysilio on the
third Sunday in every month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Abbey of Llan Egwest, or Valle
Crucis, so called from a very ancient inscribed pillar or cross,
the mutilated remains of which stand in an adjacent field, and
will next come under consideration, was built and founded by
Madog Ap Gryffydd Maelor, Lord of Dinas Bran, as before related
under the head of Dinas Bran.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>This
Abbey was built in the year of our Lord 1200, was dedicated to
the Virgin Mary, and belonged to a community of Cistercian Monks,
an order founded in France in the year 1098.&nbsp; The remains of
the Abbey Church are the most picturesque and entire part.&nbsp;
It was built in the form of a cross, which was contrary to the
form in common use before the twelfth century. <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p>This proves that Madog availed himself of the aid of skilful
workmen, and it is probable that the fraternity called Free
Masons were employed, as they were incorporated about this time,
and were the chief undertakers of such works.&nbsp; Their
government was regular, and they were wont to make an encampment
of huts.&nbsp; A <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>surveyor governed in chief; every tenth man being
called a warden, and overlooking nine.&nbsp; They ranged from one
country to another, as they found churches to be built. <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<p>The Church is built in different styles of architecture.&nbsp;
The east end seems the most ancient, and the three lancet-like
arched windows have a very peculiar effect.&nbsp; It is situated
at the foot of a lofty hill, called Fron Fawr, and a little
stream runs at the back of the Abbey, skirting its gardens, and
turning a corn-mill in its passage to the Dee.&nbsp; The view
from the high bank beyond the rivulet (which is crossed by a
rustic plank bridge) of the east end of the Church and Abbey, is
particularly beautiful.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>On
its front or west side rise the Berwyn Mountains; on the east,
the Fron Fawr; and the whole is so enveloped in beautiful foliage
that it is perhaps one of the most enchantingly secluded places
in the kingdom.&nbsp; The west front of the Church affords some
admirable specimens of ancient gothic architecture.&nbsp; The
grand entrance has been through the ornamented pointed arch
gateway at the west end; over which is a fine gothic window,
consisting of three lancet-shaped arches, surmounted by a
circular or rose window, of eight divisions; but it is too lofty
to admit of close inspection, as is also the following mutilated
inscription, which is above it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>AD . . . ADAM . . . DMS fecit hoc opus.&nbsp; Pace
beata quiescat.&nbsp; Amen.<br />
MD . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the last line is obliterated.&nbsp; <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>The
following translation may not be unacceptable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>AD . . . ADAM . . . DMS built (or rebuilt) this
work.&nbsp; May he rest in happy peace.&nbsp; Amen.<br />
MD . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letters MD seem to have been meant as part of the date
marking the time when the Church was repaired, and go far to
prove the little veneration shown to this once elegant structure
by the neighbouring people, and that its dilapidation was
unusually rapid.&nbsp; Now, we will suppose that the inscription
MD means 1500, and allow that it was then in complete repair, and
that it was one of the first Abbeys dissolved, say in 1538; for I
do not read that Henry VIII. began his reformation among the
religious houses before that time; I find in Camden&rsquo;s
Britannia, speaking of this place, the following
passage:&mdash;&ldquo;Save onely a <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>little Abbay, now <i>wholly
decaied</i>, but standing most richly and pleasantly in a vale,
which among the woody hils cutteth itself overthwart in manner of
a crosse, whereupon it was called in Latin Vallis Crucis, that
is, the Vale of the Crosse, and in British, Lhane Gwest.&rdquo;
<a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a></p>
<p>Camden&rsquo;s great work, Britannia, was published in 1586;
and from these facts I draw my conclusion that it was ransacked
and destroyed soon after its dissolution, as I suppose it
was&mdash;</p>
<p>In complete repair, A.D. 1500;</p>
<p>Dissolved by order of Henry VIII. A.D. 1538; <a

<p>Of the magnificence of this ancient Monastery no adequate
description can now be given, and scarcely an idea formed of what
it has been.&nbsp; The body and nave of the Church are
disfigured, and nearly choked up with masses of ruins, and large
and luxuriant forest trees, among which the ash and sycamore are
most predominant.&nbsp; The length of the Church is about one
hundred and eighty feet; the width I can only guess at, as the
north side is wholly gone.&nbsp; An author before me says the
nave was thirty-one feet broad, and the side aisle thirteen
feet.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>In
the north transept are the remains of a chapel, said by some to
have contained the tomb of the founder.&nbsp; In a wall in the

</blockquote>
<p>The part of the Abbey now remaining is inhabited by a farmer,
who will show the premises on proper <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>application.&nbsp; There, is a Saxon
or semicircular arched gateway in the farm-yard, adjoining a very
curious gothic window, well worthy attention.&nbsp; The dormitory
or sleeping cells were formerly entered by stone stairs from the
outside, which have been removed within the last two years.&nbsp;
The floor of the dormitory is supported by low massive pillars;
and the arches which spring from their capitals form vaulted
rooms, in which the family reside.&nbsp; There are many beautiful
features in this interesting ruin, to amply repay the attention
of the curious, and the research of the antiquarian.&nbsp; The
front seems to have been extensive, and before it gurgles up a
very pure spring of water.&nbsp; The Abbot&rsquo;s apartments
were contiguous to the church, and there opened from one of them
a small space, where he might stand, <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>and hear the holy services performed
below.</p>
<p>The venerable ruin is lessened by every succeeding tenant, and
some of the recently erected buildings exhibit stones with
mutilated devices and inscriptions worked up in the walls.&nbsp;
In one of the farmer&rsquo;s bedchambers a stone forms part of a
chimney-piece, which is carved with running foliage, and contains
this imperfect inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Arvrvet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only remain of any tomb discovered.&nbsp; In
digging a few months ago in the farm-yard, to make a drain, at a
short distance from the surface were dug up the remains of eleven
men, in a very small compass of ground, which goes far to prove
that this was the common <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>cemetery of the Abbey; and also a
wedge-like stone, having carved on its front a hand, holding a
vine or olive branch, bearing fruit.&nbsp; The stone is now at
Plas Newydd.</p>
<p>I have in my account of Castell Dinas Bran recorded that Madog
Ap Gryffydd Maelor was buried in this Abbey, A.D. 1236; and his
son, Gryffydd Ap Madog Maelor, Lord of Dinas Bran, A.D. 1270.</p>
<p>Having thus given the best account I can of the present state
of this once noble Abbey, I now proceed to state what I can
collect from authentic sources of its Abbots and its
endowments.</p>
<p>Reyner, Bishop of St. Asaph, who died in 1224, bestowed on
this Abbey half the tithes of Wrexham.&nbsp; Abraham, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>his
brother, succeeded him in the Bishoprick in 1227, and gave the
remaining half. <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a></p>
<p>Howel Ap Ednyfed, successor to Abraham, gave to it the Church
of Llangollen. <a name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b"
class="citation">[124b]</a>&nbsp; The monks also obtained,
besides these endowments, the patronage of several other livings,
as Wrexham, Ruabon, Chirk, Llansanfraid, and Llandegla.</p>
<p>The freemen of Llangollen made a grant in part of the river
near their town of a fishery to the monks of Valle Crucis; and,
for want of a seal of their own, affixed the seal of the founder
of the Abbey to the grant. <a name="citation124c"></a><a
href="#footnote124c" class="citation">[124c]</a></p>
<p>The landed endowments were, in <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>the year 1291, near the Abbey, a
grange, with three ploughlands, <a name="citation125"></a><a
href="#footnote125" class="citation">[125]</a> a mill, and other
conveniences, probably the donations of the founder Madog; the
granges of Bodhange, Tregam, Rudryn, and Baketon.&nbsp; I have no
means of ascertaining who were the donors of the farms, but I
find they had also the dairy farm of Nante; the grange of
Nostroyz, Convenet, and Grennychamt; also the grange of
Wyrcessam, consisting of one ploughland and some pasture, with
thirty cows, valued in those days at only thirty shillings.</p>
<p>All these estates were vested in the Abbot for the time being,
and formed no inconsiderable revenue; but the title of the monks
to several of the livings was disputed by a succeeding <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Bishop of
St. Asaph, called Y Brawd Du O Nannau, or the Black Brother of
Nanny, who obtained a decision in his favour.&nbsp; The third of
the tithes of Bryn Eglwys, or Egwestl, was, however, allotted to
them, in lieu of the patronage of Llandegla.</p>
<p>The monks had also a dispute with the freemen of Llangollen
respecting the fishery, the former having erected works on the
river, whereby they caught more fish than the Llangollen folks
thought came to their share, or than abstemious monks could
require.&nbsp; However, the affair was referred to the Prince of
Wales, and the fishery was confirmed to the Abbey in 1234.</p>
<p>I will now lay before my readers a short account of some of
the Abbots.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Dafydd Ap Ivan Jorwerth is highly celebrated by a bard
in the year 1480, who says of him, and of his successor, Ivan, or
John, that they lived in great splendour, that they had four
courses every day served on bright silver dishes, and they drank
claret, &amp;c.&nbsp; He also commends the piety of the house,
and says that he was so happy as to be blessed by Abbot John, who
had three of his fingers covered with rings.&nbsp; The last Abbot
was John Herne, who received an annuity of 23<i>l.</i> per annum
on his surrender.&nbsp; In 1553 this annuity, and others to some
of the surviving monks, to the amount of 10<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> were the whole of the remaining charges. <a
name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a></p>
<p>This is said to be the first Abbey that was dissolved in
Wales, and it <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>remained in the crown until the ninth of James I. who
then granted it to Edward Wotton, created Lord Wotton.&nbsp; In
1654, Margaret Wotton was in possession.&nbsp; She was a
recusant, and Cromwell then put it under sequestration to Edward
Davies, the Cneifwr Gl&acirc;s of Eglwyseg.</p>
<p>The last possessor, Mrs. Thomas, of Trevor Hall, built a kind
of summer-house at the back of the Abbey, adjoining to a pond
abounding with trout.&nbsp; Here was a charming field for the
display of taste; but, as in the hut at the top of Dinas Bran,
the opportunity has been lost.</p>
<p>Leaving the Abbey, let us now proceed through the adjoining
meadow to the Pillar of Eliseg, from which the valley takes its
name.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>La

THE PILLAR OF ELISEG.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;The time draws on<br />

Whether on land, or in the spacious sea,<br />
But must give back its long committed dust<br />
Inviolate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pillar of Eliseg is supposed to
be one of the oldest inscribed British columns now existing, and
is erected in a field about three furlongs from the Abbey,
standing in a delightful valley, to which it gives the name of
Valle Crucis, or the Vale of the Cross.&nbsp; The spot on which
it stands is a gentle elevation, and is called Llwyn y Groes,
i.e. the Grove of the Cross.&nbsp; The pillar was twelve feet <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>high, and
inscribed all round with letters.&nbsp; It stood in its place
until some of Cromwell&rsquo;s fanatical soldiers overthrew and
broke it.</p>
<p>The pillar remained cast down many years, until Trevor Lloyd,
Esq. of Trevor Hall, reared its mutilated remains again into its
base, which had not been removed, and placed upon it this Latin
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

</blockquote>
<p>Translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;T. LLOYD, of Trevor Hall, at length, in the
year 1779, restored what remains of this ancient Monument, which
had been a long time removed from sight, and
neglected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>The
Cross, or Pillar, for it seems never to have had the form of a
Cross, is now little more than eight feet high.&nbsp; The old
inscription, which time has rendered illegible, has been
carefully copied by that great antiquarian, Mr. Edward Llwyd, <a
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a> and informs us nearly of the time of
its erection, as under:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Concenn filius Cateli . . Cateli <a

Eliseg edificavit hunc Lapidem proavo suo Eliseg.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of which the following seems to be an exact
translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Concenn, the son of Cateli; Cateli the son
of Brochmail; Brochmail, the son of Eliseg; Eliseg, the son of
Cnoillaine; Concenn, therefore the great-grandson of Eliseg,
erected this stone to his great-grandfather Eliseg.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>The
characters resemble one of the alphabets in use about the sixth
century, at which time this sepulchral pillar was erected.&nbsp;
Concenn and Eliseg probably resided at Castell Dinas Bran; and a
township adjacent bears the name of Eglwyseg, as well as the
stupendous and picturesque mass of rocks that range along the
vale, called the Eglwyseg Rocks, from Eliseg.&nbsp; Brochmail,
another of the persons mentioned, deserted the protection of the
Monks of Bangor at the battle of West Chester, when twelve
hundred of those unfortunate unarmed religious were cut to pieces
by the forces of Athelfrid or Edilfred, King of Northumberland,
A.D. 607. <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a></p>
<p>Brochmail, whom I suppose to be <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the same the Latins called
Brochmailus, was a great prince in that part of Britain called
Powisland, which was then very extensive, stretching from the
Severn to the Dee in a right line, from the end of Broxon Hills
to Salop, and comprehending all the country between the Wye and
Severn.&nbsp; He resided at Pengwern Powis, now Shrewsbury, <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a> in a house situated where the College
of St. Chad now stands.&nbsp; He was a great friend and favourer
of the Monks of Bangor, and took part with them against the
Saxons, instigated by Augustine the Monk to prosecute them with
fire and sword, because they would not agree to the forms and
ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and forsake their own
established customs. <a name="citation133b"></a><a
href="#footnote133b" class="citation">[133b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>I was
so fortunate as to meet with two persons who assisted in opening
the tumulus before the pillar was re-erected; and they gave me
the following account:&mdash;On digging below the flat pedestal
in which the base of the Pillar had been inserted, they came to a
layer of pebble stones; and after having removed them, to a large
flat slab, on which it seems the body had been laid, as they now
found the remains of it, guarded round with large flat blue
stones, and covered at top with the same; the whole forming a
sort of stone box or coffin.&nbsp; The bones were entire, and of
very large dimensions.&nbsp; The skull and teeth, which were very
white and perfect, were particularly sound.&nbsp; My informants
said they believed the skull was sent to Trevor Hall, but it was
returned, and again deposited, with <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>the rest of the bones, in its former
sepulchre.&nbsp; By this it should seem that Eliseg was not an
old man when he was buried here, and it is wonderful that greater
decomposition had not taken place in twelve hundred years.</p>
<p>One of the persons who assisted at the exhumation is now a
very old man, and was huntsman to Mr. Lloyd when the tumulus was
opened.&nbsp; He says there was a large piece of silver coin
found in the coffin, which was kept; but that the skull was
gilded to preserve it, and was then again deposited with its
kindred bones.&nbsp; I asked if the bones were sound; and he
answered (I give his own words), &ldquo;O, no, sir; they broke
like gingerbread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have now reached the limits I <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>prescribed for myself on the north
side of the Dee, and trust I have noticed every thing most worthy
of attention.&nbsp; I purpose next to give a short account of the
river, and passing Llangollen Bridge, continue my route to
Glyndyfrdwy and Sycharth, once the residence of Owen Glyndwr.</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>The
River Dee</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On scenes like these the eye delights to
dwell,<br />
Here loud cascades, and there the silent dell;<br />
The lofty mountains, bleak and barren, rise,<br />
And spread their ample bosoms to the skies;<br />
While still the rushing river rolls along,<br />
The theme of many a humble shepherd&rsquo;s song,<br />
And as it rolls, the trout, in speckled pride,<br />
Springs playful in the smooth translucent tide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river Dee forms a beautiful and
interesting feature in all the most picturesque views around
Llangollen.&nbsp; Passing from Glyndyfrdwy down the river, it
successively assumes the appearance of the brawling brook over
beds of pebbles; the deep tranquil character of the gliding lake,
reflecting on its pure bosom the woods and mountains that
surround it; the rushing cascade <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>or rapids, over beds of rocks, or
through chasms of stone.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The current that with gentle murmur
glides,<br />
Opposed by rocks impatiently doth rage;<br />
But when his fair course is not hindered,<br />
He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,<br />
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br />
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;<br />
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br />
With willing sport to the wild ocean.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It rises a few miles beyond Bala, a town about twenty miles
from Llangollen, on the west, and runs through a pool now called
Bala pool, some say without mingling its stream. <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a>&nbsp; There is no river in England
which has been so much celebrated by our poets for its sanctity
as the Dee; and Camden describes it as &ldquo;riseing on the east
sideof Merionethshire, and forthwith passeth entire and whole
through Lhintegid, in <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>English, Pimble Meare, or Plenlin
Meare, <a name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a> a lake spreding far in length and
bredth; and so runneth out of it with as great a streame as it
entred in; for neither shal a man see in the Dee the fishes
called guiniad, which are peculiar to the Meare, nor yet salmons
in the Meare, which neverthelesse are commonly taken in the
river.&rdquo; <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a></p>
<p>The mazy windings of the Dee, embellished as its banks are
with the fresh green shrubs and plants which flourish there in
great luxuriance, afford a very delightful walk, independent of
the great amusement to anglers for which this river has ever been
so famous.&nbsp; The trout are as fine as any in the kingdom, and
<a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>are very
plentiful.&nbsp; Many men obtain a livelihood during the season,
by fishing in this beautiful river, which they contrive to manage
in their little coracles, a large kind of round basket, covered
with skins or tarpawling, and with a board across the centre for
a seat.&nbsp; It is amusing to see them waft themselves where
they please, with a little paddle in one hand, and a fly-rod in
the other, fishing every corner of the deep pool; and when tired,
rowing to land, throwing their boats on their shoulders, and
walking with them to another deep pool, where they again commence
operations.</p>
<p>Salmon come up the river to spawn; and although so many do not
reach Llangollen as in former times, owing to the new inventions
erected on the river to entrap them <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>in their way from the sea, yet many
of them overcome all impediments, and reach their usual
haunts.&nbsp; I saw last summer, at the season when the salmon
fray, or fry, seek their way to the sea from the river where they
have been bred, large shoals of these fish, and at one time more
than forty fishing rods successfully employed in a small space of
water near the water-mill just above the bridge.&nbsp; This
fishery continued in great activity for many days; the bait used
being a common ground-worm, or a straw-worm, here called
corbet.&nbsp; A little fresh in the river at length came, of
which the fish took advantage, and proceeded on their way, after
having lost some thousands of their numbers at Llangollen.</p>
<p>The otter is found in this river, and, owing to the many
fastnesses, <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>can seldom be destroyed.&nbsp; There are also numerous
and various aquatic birds.&nbsp; The rock-ousel, the kingfisher,
the sand-piper, the crane, and a duck-like bird, with black and
white plumeage, which the inhabitants term a cormorant, are very
common.</p>
<p>About a mile above the bridge is a deep chasm in the rocky
bed, through which the whole river, when not swollen,
rushes.&nbsp; It is six yards across, and bears the name of Llam
Y Lleidr, i.e. Thief&rsquo;s Leap, from the circumstance of a
robber, who was pursued closely, having possessed sufficient
agility to clear this space, while his unfortunate pursuer fell
short, and was engulphed in the roaring torrent, narrowly
escaping the loss of life, as well as of property.&nbsp; There is
another chasm nearer the <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>bridge, still deeper and narrower,
called the Cow&rsquo;s Leap.</p>
<p>The river runs over a bed of dark-coloured silicious rock,
which is sometimes got by the inhabitants for the use of
building.&nbsp; The bed of the river is consequently very uneven,
which causes it to foam and rush very impetuously along.</p>
<h3>The Bridge</h3>
<p>Is a plain gothic structure at the west end of Llangollen, and
consists of four irregularly formed pointed arches, with
projecting angular buttresses.&nbsp; The bridge was built across
the Dee by John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph, and Chancellor of
Chester, A.D. 1346, and was accounted one of the wonders of
Wales.&nbsp; The arches are of various dimensions, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>but the
only wonder I can discover seems to be the foundation, which is
laid upon the rock that forms the bed of the river, and is
fastened thereto with iron clamps.&nbsp; The bridge is built of
hewn stone, and is, like most other old bridges, very narrow and
ill-paved.</p>
<p>Many wonderful tales are related of the sudden rise of this
river, and it certainly is a very inconstant stream; but I cannot
conceive it possible that the water should ever have risen, as
reported, so high as the base of the parapet.&nbsp; There is
another little bridge called the Chain Bridge, about two miles up
the river.</p>
<p>I will now cross the bridge to the south side of the
river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> five miles west of
Llangollen, upon the road to Corwen, and on the south side of the
Dee, the way being enriched by such varied and enchanting scenery
as will amply repay the traveller of taste for the fatigue of the
excursion, is Glyn Dyfrdwy, once the property and residence of
that famous chieftain Owen Glyndwr, whose birth Shakspeare says
marked him extraordinary.&nbsp; I will, however, here give a
short account of his life, which I <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>trust will prove entertaining to
many of my readers, and plainly show that &ldquo;he was not in
the roll of common men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Ap Gryffydd Fychan, better known by the name of Owen
Glyndwr, <a name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a> was descended from a younger son of
Gryffydd Ap Madog, Lord of Powis Bromfeild, and of Dinas
Bran.&nbsp; He received his education in one of the inns of
court, and became a barrister-at-law.</p>
<p>It seems that about the year of our Lord 1395, he came into
great favour with King Richard II. who made him his scutifer, or
shield-bearer; <a name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b"
class="citation">[146b]</a> and Owen was with the King when he
was surrendered to <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Henry, Duke of Lancaster, together with the Castle of
Flint. <a name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a"
class="citation">[147a]</a></p>
<p>Betwixt Owen and Reginald, Lord Grey, of Ruthin, there arose a
fierce dispute, about a common lying between the Lordship of
Ruthin and Glyndyfrdwy, and belonging to Owen, who now assumed
the name of Glyndwr; and who was held in great respect by his
countrymen, having artfully induced them to believe that he could
&ldquo;call spirits from the vasty deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reginald
was at first conquered, and Owen possessed the disputed land; but
after the deposal and murder of King Richard in Pomfret Castle,
and Henry had mounted the throne, <a name="citation147b"></a><a
href="#footnote147b" class="citation">[147b]</a> the scene was
changed; as Henry <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>aided Lord Grey, who with his own vassals, and assisted
by some of the King&rsquo;s forces, again dispossessed Owen of
the land.&nbsp; Several severe encounters took place between the
rival chieftains; and although Reginald&rsquo;s adherents were
more numerous, the wily lawyer was more fertile in
expedients.</p>
<p>Owen, being apprised of an attack intended to be made upon him
by Lord Grey, here practised a successful ruse de guerre.&nbsp;
He erected a number of stakes in a bottom still called
<i>D&ocirc;l Benig</i>, <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a> and having clad
them in jackets and Welch caps, so alarmed Reginald by their
appearance that he gave up the expedition.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>At
length Owen&rsquo;s good fortune and perseverance brought his
enemy into his power. <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a>&nbsp; Having
artfully drawn Reginald from his strong hold of Ruthin, he caused
his horses to be shod backwards, which induced Reginald to
advance, supposing he was pursuing a flying enemy, when he fell
into an ambuscade, and was suddenly surrounded by Owen&rsquo;s
forces, and made prisoner.&nbsp; Owen then marched to Ruthin,
burnt the castle, destroyed the town, and despoiled the country.
<a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a></p>
<p>Prior to this success, Owen had laid his complaints before the
King&rsquo;s Parliament, and John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph,
and Chancellor of Chester, seeing that no attention was paid to
his petition, after a long <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>delay, ventured to expostulate with
the Lords, and to caution them that they did not, by slighting or
neglecting Owen&rsquo;s complaint, provoke the Welch to
insurrection.&nbsp; The reply of the Lords was full of contempt,
saying, &ldquo;They did not fear those rascally bare-footed
people.&rdquo; <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a>&nbsp; It was subsequent to this time
that Glyndwr, finding his suit neglected, resolved to endeavour
to redress his own wrongs, which terminated in the capture of
Reginald, as before related.</p>
<p>This signal success drew to Owen many of his countrymen from
all parts of the principality, who urged him on, asserting that
the period was now arrived in which the prophecies of Merlin
would be <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>fulfilled; and that he was the man through whose valour
the lost honour and liberties of their native country were to be
recovered.</p>
<p>Owen Glyndwr, smarting with resentment, and impelled by his
ambition, suffered himself to be persuaded to undertake the
emancipation of the principality; and in the mean time kept
Reginald Lord Grey a close prisoner; demanding ten thousand marks
for his ransom; six thousand to be paid on the feast of St.
Martin, in the fourth year of the King&rsquo;s reign, and
Reginald to deliver up his eldest son, with other persons of
quality, as hostages for the due performance. <a
name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a></p>
<p>The King, at the humble suit of <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Lord Grey (he finding no other means
for his enlargement), appointed a council to treat with Glyndwr,
who stoutly refusing to recede from his terms, they agreed to
give him the sum demanded.&nbsp; It is also said that Owen
obliged Reginald to marry one of his daughters. <a
name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a"
class="citation">[152a]</a></p>
<p>Owen, being thus amply provided with money, and joined by
numbers of his countrymen, now flew at higher game, and boldly
attacked the Earl of March, who met him with a numerous body of
Herefordshire men.&nbsp; They came to close action, when the
Welchmen under Owen proved victorious, and the Earl of March was
taken prisoner, some accounts say by Owen himself in single
combat. <a name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b"
class="citation">[152b]</a>&nbsp; With his freedom he lost above
a <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>thousand men, who were most savagely abused after they
were dead.</p>
<p>Edmund, Earl of March, whom Owen Glyndwr now held in thraldom,
was next in blood to Richard II. and therefore it was not
displeasing to King Henry that he should be thus kept out of the
way: nay, Camden says&mdash;&ldquo;He (Edmund) stood greatly
suspected to Henrie the Fourth, who had usurped the kingdome; and
by him was first exposed unto danger, insomuch as he was taken by
Owen Glyndwr, a rebell.&rdquo; <a name="citation153"></a><a
href="#footnote153" class="citation">[153]</a>&nbsp; King Henry,
therefore, as might be supposed, turned a deaf ear to every
solicitation made on the Earl&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>Now it was that Glyndwr, flushed <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>with success, resolved to assume the
title of Prince of Wales; and treating the King as a usurper of
the crown, and simply as Duke of Lancaster, he caused himself to
be proclaimed throughout the Principality.&nbsp; The better to
grace the matter, he feigned himself descended in the female line
from Llewellyn Ap Gruffydh, the last Prince.</p>
<p>His ambition now knew no bounds; and, by virtue of his new
title, he summoned a parliament at Machynlleth, in
Montgomeryshire, whither all the nobility and gentry of Wales
resorted.&nbsp; He kept his court at Sychnant, about seven miles
from Llangollen, on the road to Corwen.&nbsp; It is now
distinguished by a grove of firs, situated in a beautifully
fertile country, and overlooking the Dee.&nbsp; A few scattered
stones <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>are all that remain to mark the site where the palace
of Owen Glyndwr once stood, which his bard, Iolo Goch, sung was
as large as Westminster Abbey. <a name="citation155"></a><a
href="#footnote155" class="citation">[155]</a></p>
<p>About the middle of August, 1402, Henry, finding the power of
Owen Glyndwr increasing, and the turbulence of the Welch breaking
all bounds, resolved to crush their rebellion, and putting
himself at the head of a powerful army, marched into Wales.&nbsp;
But the very elements seemed to fight against him, the weather
proving so extraordinarily inclement that the King was obliged <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>to make a
precipitate retreat, without accomplishing his intentions. <a
name="citation156a"></a><a href="#footnote156a"
class="citation">[156a]</a>&nbsp; The people attributed the
dreadful tempests which at that season occurred to the magic
power of Owen, who found it his interest to encourage their
credulity.</p>
<p>Edward Mortimer, perceiving the King had no intention of
opening his prison doors, and Glyndwr treating him with increased
gentleness and respect, fell into the scheme this artful and
politic man had devised.&nbsp; Owen Glyndwr <a
name="citation156b"></a><a href="#footnote156b"
class="citation">[156b]</a> was married to Margaret, the only
daughter of Sir David Hanmer, of Hanmer, in Flintshire (who was
one of the Justices of the King&rsquo;s Bench, and was knighted
by King Richard <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>II.) by whom he had many children; and at this time
three of his daughters were unmarried, on one of whom the captive
Earl cast an eye of affection.&nbsp; Glyndwr at once saw the
advantage of this predilection, and proposed to league with him
against the King, and to cement this union by the marriage of his
daughter to the Earl.</p>
<p>To strengthen this league, and make the proposed insurrection
irresistible, the Earls of Worcester and Northumberland, two of
the most powerful Nobles in England, together with the Scottish
Chief Douglas, and Northumberland&rsquo;s valiant son Henry
Percy, better known by the name of Hotspur, were invited to join
their standards; and these rebellious Lords met at the house of
Dafyd Daron, the Archdeacon <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>of Bangor, <a
name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a"
class="citation">[158a]</a> and there signed an indenture,
sealing it with their own seals, to bind themselves to assemble
their forces, and join in putting down the King, and for dividing
the kingdom, vainly relying upon a foolish prediction of Merlin,
in which the King was depicted as an execrable moldwarp, and
Glyndwr and his colleagues as the wolf, the lion, and the dragon,
that were to pull the moldwarp down. <a
name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b"
class="citation">[158b]</a></p>
<p>This treaty, made with so much secrecy, and executed in the
recesses of Glyndwr&rsquo;s dominions, was soon communicated to
King Henry.&nbsp; Sir David Gam, so called because he had a
crooked eye, or squinted, or, as some say, had but one eye, <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>was a
strong and faithful partizan of the Duke of Lancaster, now King
Henry IV. and consequently the inveterate enemy of Owen Glyndwr,
now Prince of Wales, at whose Parliament he attended, together
with the chief of the Welch nobles and gentry, but with very
different intentions; he having determined to put an end to
Glyndwr&rsquo;s rebellion with his life. <a
name="citation159a"></a><a href="#footnote159a"
class="citation">[159a]</a></p>
<p>David Gam was the son of Llewellyn Ap Howel Vaughn, a
gentleman of Brecknock.&nbsp; His scheme and his purpose were,
however, unfortunately for him, discovered and frustrated, and he
was immediately secured, and ordered by Owen for execution; <a
name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a> but many of his greatest <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>friends and
adherents pleading for Gam&rsquo;s life, Owen thought it politic
then to stifle his resentment, and to grant him both life and
liberty, on his solemnly promising to continue in future true and
faithfully loyal to Glyndwr.</p>
<p>The promises of men in those days were frequently regarded
only so long as it suited their interests or convenience.&nbsp;
Such was the case with David Gam, who no sooner found himself
among his own friends, and in his own country, than he began to
assail and annoy all the favourers and adherents of Glyndwr, who
being soon apprised of the practices against him, and of the use
Sir David made of his liberty, marched with all expedition at the
head of a small body of his retainers, intending to make him
prisoner; <a name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a> <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>but Sir David had the good fortune
to elude his vigilance, and escaped into England, where he lived
for the most part at court, not daring to visit his native
country until after the death of Owen Glyndwr.</p>
<p>Having thus missed his prey, Owen set no bounds to his
resentment.&nbsp; He burnt Gam&rsquo;s house to the ground,
wasted his substance, despoiled his tenants and friends, and by
the rigor of his proceedings so estranged the hearts of all, and
created so many enemies, that it was reasonable to expect that
through Sir David&rsquo;s means, or some of his emissaries, the
King would have information of what was plotting against him in
Wales.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Henry
at this time, fortunately, had a small army assembled for another
purpose; and no sooner was he apprised of this conspiracy against
him, than, placing himself at the head of his troops, he marched
them for Wales, to attack the confederates before they had time
to conjoin their forces. <a name="citation162a"></a><a
href="#footnote162a" class="citation">[162a]</a>&nbsp; Owen had
not collected all his strength,<a name="citation162b"></a><a
href="#footnote162b" class="citation">[162b]</a> and the Earl of
Northumberland, who was considered generalissimo, being seized
with a sudden illness, and confined to his bed at
Berwick-upon-Tweed, the King found the rebels under the command
of Hotspur at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The insurgent chiefs, seeing a battle inevitable, and knowing
that <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Glyndwr, with his hardy Welchmen, was in full march to
join them (in fact, he reached Oswestry at the head of 12,000 men
on the very day the battle was fought), to gain time proposed a
conference, and drew up a list of grievances to be redressed; but
the matter ended in mutual recrimination, and both sides prepared
for battle.&nbsp; The numbers were nearly equal, about 12,000 on
each side, and the two armies were inflamed by the most dreadful
animosity.</p>
<p>The battle began with the most determined courage.&nbsp; The
King was seen every where animating his troops in the post of
danger, and he was most nobly seconded by his son, afterwards the
renowned Henry V. the conqueror of France.&nbsp; On the other
side the chieftains fought like men accustomed to the bloody
business <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>of war; and the battle was fierce, obstinate, and
doubtful; when the daring Hotspur, supporting the high character
which he had purchased by so many victories, and seeking a
personal encounter with the King, fell by an unknown hand.</p>
<p>The loss of their gallant leader was the loss of the
battle.&nbsp; The fortune of the King prevailed; and although on
that day no less than two thousand six hundred gentlemen, and six
thousand common men were slain, this victory served to confirm
Henry on his usurped throne, humbled the great Barons, and
restored peace to England.&nbsp; Had Owen Glyndwr at this
juncture pressed forward from Oswestry, where it has been before
said he was lying with a fresh army, and as numerous as the
English were before <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>they had sustained so severe a loss,
he might have changed the aspect of affairs; but at this distance
of time a proper judgment cannot be formed.&nbsp; Some historians
blame him for his precipitate retreat into Wales, whither he was
followed by a part of the English army, under young Henry, who
made himself master of the Castle of Aberystwith, which Owen
afterwards recaptured.</p>
<p>After this time Owen&rsquo;s fortunes appeared to decline, <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a> and the fatal battle of Husk, fought
on the 15th of March, in which Glyndwr&rsquo;s son was taken, and
more than fifteen hundred of his men slain, seems to have sealed
his doom.&nbsp; But Glyndwr, although reduced, was not subdued,
and he continued a predatory and <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>harassing warfare, most annoying and
destructive; sometimes making a sudden eruption into the marches,
and sometimes into the heart of the country; for now, the Welch
having submitted to the King, and being reconciled, Glyndwr
considered his countrymen his enemies.&nbsp; His skill in
devices, together with his local knowledge of the country, kept
the Principality in a dreadful state of fear and fermentation;
and although he eluded every effort made to entrap him, yet his
turbulent spirit drew upon his country the vengeance of the King,
in the most severe laws that were ever enacted against a
civilised people. <a name="citation166"></a><a
href="#footnote166" class="citation">[166]</a></p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Owen
Glyndwr, once Prince of Wales, was now reduced to hide himself in
the caves and fastnesses of the country, to avoid the pursuit of
his enemies.&nbsp; He was concealed and supported for some time
by Ednyfed Ap Aron, in a cave near the sea-side, at Llangelynin,
in Merionethshire, still called Ogof Owain. <a
name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a>&nbsp; The danger past, he again <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>blazed
forth in the destruction of a territory he had once aspired to
govern; sometimes a fugitive, enduring hunger, thirst, and every
privation; at others revelling as a conqueror, on the spoils of
his countrymen and former friends.&nbsp; At last his depredations
became so general and so indiscriminate that he feared every one,
and became as &ldquo;a wild man, and his hand was against every
man, and every man&rsquo;s hand was against him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Being thus driven by his fears from society, he fled to the most
solitary places, and at length died for lack of sustenance. <a
name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a></p>
<p>Thus ignobly perished Owen Ap Gryffydd Fychan, commonly known
by the name of Owen Glyndwr&mdash;a <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>man who, from trifling causes, had
conceived more determined hostility against the English, and had
conducted that hostility with more consummate skill, than any
other general the Welch had ever produced.&nbsp; In his early
career he was uniformly victorious: he was proclaimed Prince of
Wales with the sanction of the chief men of the country, made
alliances with princes, and exercised his authority with becoming
dignity; but now&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mighty victor, mighty Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Low on his funeral couch he lies:<br />
No pitying heart, no eye t&rsquo; afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear to grace his obsequies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owen Glyndwr was one of those fiery meteors which Providence
sometimes permits to visit the earth, for the instruction of
mankind, and to show us the vanity of all sublunary things:
astonishing the world with <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>their splendour, they blaze for a
short time; and as suddenly decline, and sink into
obscurity.&nbsp; Such, in our own horizon, have been Glyndwr and
Cromwell, and in later times Bonaparte.&nbsp; Their course was
brilliant, but short; and as their greatness grew, so did their
suspicions and their fears; until, at last, life itself became
burdensome, and the end of their career was clouded by
disappointment, misery, and despair.</p>
<p>But Owen Glyndwr had more legitimate reasons to plead than
either of his compeers.&nbsp; Deprived of a part of his patrimony
by power, and unable to obtain redress by law, he took the law
into his own hands, and had recourse to force.&nbsp; Success
produced ambition, which proved his overthrow.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Owen
was bold, wary, and revengeful: he set no bounds to his
resentment.&nbsp; He made a smoking ruin of the dwelling of his
countryman, Sir David Gam, and thereby made him an implacable
enemy.&nbsp; He was the cause of the loss of one hundred thousand
lives, <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> and of the destruction of immense
property.&nbsp; Many houses and other buildings were burnt and
destroyed by him; among which I find enumerated the Castle of
Ruthin, the Cathedral of St. Asaph, the Cathedral of Bangor, the
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace, &amp;c. at Llandaff, the towns of
Leominster and Old Radnor, besides the house of Sir David Gam,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>It will be right to notice that Mr. Pennant gives the
following account <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>of the death of Owen Glyndwr; but as he states there is
nothing confirmatory of Owen&rsquo;s interment at Monnington, I
have thought it right to adhere to the older
authorities:&mdash;&ldquo;He matched his daughters,&rdquo; says
Mr. Pennant, &ldquo;into considerable families: his eldest,
Isabel, to Adam Ap Iorwerth Ddu; his second, Elizabeth, or as
some say, Alicia, to Sir John Scudamore, of Ewyas, and Home Lacy,
in Herefordshire; Jane he forced upon Lord Grey De Ruthin; and
his youngest daughter, Margaret, to Roger Monnington, of
Monnington, in Herefordshire, at whose house some accounts say he
died, and was buried in the church-yard there.&rdquo; <a
name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172"
class="citation">[172]</a></p>
<p>The prison where Owen confined <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>his captives, and of which some
remains may still be seen, was near the church at Llansanfraid
Glyndyfrdwy; and the place is still called Carchardy Owen
Glyndwr.&nbsp; He is said to have died in the sixty-first year of
his age.</p>
<p>I trust it will be deemed a pardonable digression, if I now
give the sequel of the military career of that loyal and truly
brave Welchman, Sir David Gam.&nbsp; I have before recounted that
Glyndwr forced him to fly for protection to the court of England,
where he continued in favour with King Henry IV. until the death
of that monarch.&nbsp; I then find him accompanying his son, King
Henry V. on his expedition into France, in the year of our Lord
1415, at the head and in the command of a numerous body of stout
and valiant <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Welchmen, who on all occasions distinguished themselves
by their courage and conduct. <a name="citation174"></a><a
href="#footnote174" class="citation">[174]</a></p>
<p>To Sir David Gam was assigned the important office of
reconnoitring the French army, on the approach of the famous
battle of Agincourt.&nbsp; Finding the French nearly ten times
more numerous than the English army, he replied to the
King&rsquo;s question as to the enemy&rsquo;s
strength&mdash;&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please you, my Liege, they are
enough to be killed, enough to run away, and enough to be taken
prisoners.&rdquo;&nbsp; The King was well pleased with such an
answer from a man of Sir David&rsquo;s valour.</p>
<p>In the battle which followed, and which was fought on the 25th
of <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>October, 1415, the King alighted from his horse to head
his footmen, and to encourage them to resist the charge of the
second line of the French army, then advancing; when eighteen
French cavaliers, who had bound themselves by an oath to kill
King Henry, or perish, rushed upon him in a body, and one of them
with a blow of his battle-axe so stunned the King that he would
have fallen an easy victim, had not Sir David Gam, with his
son-in-law, Roger Vaughn, and his kinsman, Walter Llwyd, of
Brecknock, seasonably sprung to his rescue.&nbsp; They slew
fourteen of the assailants, and delivered the King, when they
fell at his feet, covered with wounds.&nbsp; In the heat of the
battle, Henry was separated from his brave defenders; but being
soon afterwards informed that their wounds were mortal, he <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>immediately
repaired to the spot where Sir David and his faithful companions
lay; and, as the only recompense in his power then to bestow, he
knighted them all three upon the field, where they soon after
died. <a name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>Thus ended the life of Sir David Gam; but the remembrance of
his loyalty, and the fame of his valour, will live, and
perpetuate his memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So sleep the brave, who sink to rest,<br />
By all their country&rsquo;s wishes bless&rsquo;d.<br />
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,<br />
Returns to deck their hallow&rsquo;d mould,<br />
She there shall dress a sweeter sod<br />
Than Fancy&rsquo;s feet have ever trod.<br />
By fairy hands their knell is rung,<br />
By forms unseen their dirge is sung.<br />
There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey,<br />
To bless the turf that wraps their clay;<br />
And Freedom shall awhile repair,<br />
To dwell a weeping hermit there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>It is
conjectured that Shakspeare took Sir David as a specimen, when he
wrote the character of Captain Fluellen, in Henry V.</p>
<p>Returning towards Llangollen from Glyndyfrdwy, along a
beautiful level road, made at the expense of Government, with the
Berwyn Mountains rising abruptly on the right hand, and the
murmuring Dee pursuing its devious course on the left, I pass a
small brook, which divides the counties of Merioneth and
Denbigh.&nbsp; A pillar on the top of the mountain above is for
the same purpose.&nbsp; The views over the Dee are incomparably
charming.</p>

Church.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hail, ancient edifice; thine aisle

&nbsp;&nbsp; In contemplation wrapt, now let me stray;<br />
And stealing from the idly busy throng,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoutly meditate the moral lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Llangollen</span> Church, which stands in
the middle of the town, is a low gothic structure; and the south
side appears the most ancient part of the edifice.&nbsp; At the
east end, on the outside wall, are two knees, which seem to have
been intended as the spring of an arch, for an enlargement of the
building.&nbsp; The roof is slated, and there is a tower steeple
at the west end, containing four bells and a clock, with quarter
chimes.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The
Church is dedicated to Saint Collen Ap Gwynnawg, Ap Clydawg, Ap
Cowdra, Ap Caradog Freichfras, Ap Lleyr Merim, Ap Einion Yrth, Ap
Cunedda Wledig, by Ethni Wyddeles, daughter of Matholwch, Lord of
Cwl, in the kingdom of Ireland; <a name="citation179"></a><a
href="#footnote179" class="citation">[179]</a> which saint was
buried here.&nbsp; In the Church was formerly a recumbent figure
in alabaster, vulgarly called Saint Collen.&nbsp; The unshapely
remains of this monument are still to be seen in the belfry,
where it has been thrown.</p>
<p>The roof of the Church is supported with three massive stone
octagon Doric pillars, of great antiquity, and two heavy
abutments.&nbsp; The roof itself is very curiously enriched with
carved compartments, <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>in old oak, supported by figures of
angels, in various attitudes, also of solid oak.&nbsp; These
figures and the roof I suspect to be spoils of the Abbey Crucis,
to which the Church of Llangollen was incumbent.&nbsp; The
transom beams that support the roof are indented with tracery;
and on the north side of the beam over the north aisle, is the
following very curious inscription cut in old letter.&nbsp; It is
so lofty that it can scarcely be made out distinctly, but I have
taken some pains to give it correctly:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Y nav i ti mair vydd barod bob
awr.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heaven for thee, Mary, will be open every
hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have little doubt that this beam, as well as the other
decorations of the roof of the Church, was brought <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>from Llan
Egwest, which it will be recollected was dedicated to the Virgin
Mary.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful half-length of our Saviour in the window
over the altar, painted upon glass by Eginton, of Birmingham,
with this inscription under it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nid fy Ewyllys i ond yr eiddo ti a
wneler.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">S. Luc pen 22 ver 42.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my will, but thine be done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe there are no other Welch inscriptions in the Church,
among the many grave stones, tablets, &amp;c. which abound; and
yet service is performed in no other language, except on the
second sabbath in every month, and on Good Friday.&nbsp; There
are many English families now resident in Llangollen and its
neighbourhood; and to those that <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>are seriously disposed this is a
great privation.</p>
<p>The Church is well served by the very worthy and pious Vicar,
who resides at the Vicarage; yet, notwithstanding, there are four
dissenting congregations in the town, viz. Wesleyan Methodists,
Whitfield or Calvinistic Methodists, Independents, and
Baptists.</p>
<p>In the church-yard is a school, under which is a vestry-room,
bearing this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;This school-house was
built at the expense of the parishioners, having obtained the
ordinary license, with consent of the Rev. R. Price, vicar,
1773.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customs of the orthodox Welch Church are similar to those
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>in
England, except in the following, viz. that of bedecking the
graves of the dead with shrubs and flowers; of singing before the
corpse to the church; and the very annoying one of ringing a
passing bell in the following manner:&mdash;On the day prior to
the funeral the bells are tolled in a very quick succession of
strokes; that is to say, twelve quick strokes on the first bell,
and after a short pause, twelve on the second; and so on once
round, the number of strokes on each bell, denoting the condition
of the deceased.&nbsp; Thus, twelve strokes on each bell denote
the death of a married master of a family; eleven strokes the
mother or mistress of a family; ten strokes an unmarried or young
man; nine a young woman unmarried; six a boy; and five a
girl.&nbsp; Then begins an incessant monotonous toll of the <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>great bell,
in minute time, which generally continues all that day until
eight o&rsquo;clock at night: it commences again at eight
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, and does not cease until
eight o&rsquo;clock at night, except during the time of
interment.&nbsp; The usage at the burial is also novel to an
English observer.&nbsp; When the service in the church is
concluded, the officiating minister goes to the steps of the
altar, whereon a sort of wooden plate is previously placed; and
the attendants and friends of the deceased immediately proceed to
deposit money thereon in his presence, which is instead of
dues.&nbsp; When the corpse is consigned to the earth, the clerk
receives the donations of the people that are around the grave,
upon the spade with which he is throwing the earth upon the
coffin; and this is his share of the fees.</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>There
is also an old and curious custom observed at Christmas, called
Plygan, or Pylgain, that is, &ldquo;the time of night when the
cock croweth; the morning twilight.&rdquo;&mdash;On the morning
of Christmas Day, the bells are rung as is usual to assemble to
church, about four o&rsquo;clock; and on their ringing about six
o&rsquo;clock, most of the parishioners assemble, some bringing
candles, and the church is also lighted up.&nbsp; After the
prayers (morning service for the day) are read, the congregation
continue, and the minister also, hearing original carols in the
Welch language, on our Saviour&rsquo;s nativity.&nbsp; This time
and custom were formerly much more seriously observed, when men
believed</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That ever &rsquo;gainst that season
comes<br />
Wherein our Saviour&rsquo;s birth is celebrated,<br />
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;<br />
And then they say no spirit walks abroad;<br />
<a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>The
nights are wholesome, then no planets strike;<br />
No fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm;<br />
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except two or three marble monuments in the Church, there are
no other remarkable objects; but in the church-yard are many very
neat and handsome freestone tombs.&nbsp; Some of those recently
erected are in the sarcophagus form, and are very nicely
executed.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite the south door of the Church stands a
triangular gothic column of freestone, surrounded by a light iron
railing, erected over the grave of a highly respected domestic of
the Right Hon. Lady E. Butler, and the Hon. Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp;
The pillar is executed in good taste, and on one of the three
facades are the following lines, doing much honour to the heart
as well as to the head of the composer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>In Memory
of<br />
Mrs. Mary Carol,<br />
Deceased the 22d of November, 1809,<br />
This Monument is erected,<br />
By Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby,<br />
Of Plas Newydd, in this Parish.</p>
<p>Released from earth, and all its transient woes,<br />
She whose remains beneath this stone repose,<br />
Steadfast in faith, resign&rsquo;d her parting breath,<br />
Look&rsquo;d up with Christian zeal, and smiled in death;<br />
Patient, industrious, faithful, gen&rsquo;rous, kind,<br />
Her conduct left the proudest far behind;<br />
Her virtues dignified her humble birth,<br />
And raised her mind beyond this sordid earth.<br />
Attachment, sacred bond of grateful breasts,<br />
Extinguish&rsquo;d but with life this tomb attests,<br />
Rear&rsquo;d by two friends, who will her loss bemoan,<br />
Till with her ashes here shall rest their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor of Llangollen have much reason to pray that period
may be far distant; for the benevolence of these retired ladies
is extensive and discriminate; and it may justly be said there is
not a poor deserving object in this little town, who does not
participate in their bounty.&nbsp; I shall conclude with a brief
notice of their residence.</p>
<h2><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Plas
Newydd.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pleasant through the loopholes
of retreat<br />
To peep at the great world&mdash;to see the stir<br />
Of the great Babel, and not feel the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Plas</span> Newydd, situated at the east
end of the town of Llangollen, has long been the residence of two
eminently distinguished ladies, the Right Hon. Lady Eleanor
Butler and the Hon. Miss Ponsonby, who came to Llangollen, and
after a time purchased the domain, and planted and decorated the
grounds.&nbsp; It has attained its present beauty under their own
superintendance.</p>
<p>Many years have elapsed since these ladies withdrew from the
world, to which, from their rank and <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>accomplishments, they would have
been distinguished ornaments, and secluded themselves in this
beautiful retreat, where they have uniformly been the
benefactresses of the poor, the encouragers of the industrious,
and the friends of all in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; The peculiar
taste and beauty with which these noble and highly distinguished
ladies have decorated and adorned both the exterior and the
interior of their far-famed retreat, excites universal admiration
from the first characters and families, who are continually
visiting them.</p>
<p>A palisade, ornamented with antique and grotesque figures,
carved in oak, encloses the front, before which a profusion of
the choicest flowers and shrubs is tastefully arranged.&nbsp; The
entrance and the <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>windows, which are formed after the manner of ancient
religious houses, are decorated with carving in the same
material.&nbsp; The entrance-door is unique, and a great
curiosity, being beautifully ornamented with well polished carved
figures; the whole of which are of black oak, and kept
particularly bright, giving the retreat a very uncommon
appearance.&nbsp; The entrance-hall, stairs, and passages, are
chastely in character; and the windows are ornamented with
painted glass in the most appropriate manner.</p>
<p>The gardens, in which nature and art are judiciously united,
are extensive, and display much taste.&nbsp; The thick and
umbrageous foliage of the lofty forest trees, that occupy a part
of the lawn and gardens, is <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the safe asylum of numerous birds,
which in this calm seclusion revel unmolested.&nbsp; A pair of
beautiful wood-owls have found a safe and quiet shelter in the
trunk of an old ivy-covered tree; and on a lawn a little further,
is erected a pretty moss-covered alcove, furnished with a few
well-selected books: it is nearly in the centre of the garden,
and is open in front.&nbsp; The confidence of the birds is shown
by some of them every year building their nests in this recess:
indeed, these airy inhabitants appear to be quite tame and
familiarized by the kindness of their amiable protectors.&nbsp; I
believe the birds have much the larger portion of the produce of
these beautiful gardens, as none of them are suffered to be
molested.</p>
<p>Through the lower part of the <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>shrubbery, a brook, called Cyflymen,
i.e. Speedy, murmurs o&rsquo;er its pebbly bed, and is crossed by
a rustic bridge, which leads to a bank covered with lichens, and
furnished with appropriate seats, near which rises a pure
fountain, whose waters are as clear as the crystal glasses which
ornament its margin: in short, the beauty of the scenery, aided
by a little enthusiam, might inspire the idea that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here in cool grot and mossy cell,<br />
The rural fays and fairies dwell:<br />
Though rarely seen by mortal eye,<br />
When the pale moon, ascending high,<br />
Darts through yon limes her quiv&rsquo;ring beams,<br />
They frisk it near these crystal streams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carved stone brought from the Abbey Crucis, and mentioned
as being dug up at the time the bodies were discovered, stands
near the entrance.</p>

193</span>CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p>I have thus completed the circuit I proposed at the
commencement of my labours.&nbsp; To hope the attainment of
perfection in a work of this nature would with justice be deemed
presumptuous; but I trust any inaccuracy will be treated with
lenity, and that due allowance will be made for the disadvantage
under which verbal information is at all times collected by a
person who does not understand the native language.&nbsp; Thus
far I can with truth say, that, from a desire to combine
correctness with intelligence, I have in no case given that on
hearsay, which might be readily ascertained by ocular
demonstration.</p>
<p>With regard to the quotations which I have thought proper to
introduce, I must here again draw <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>upon the kind indulgence of my
readers.&nbsp; Not having an extensive library at my command, I
have sometimes been obliged to quote from memory.&nbsp; This will
also, in some degree, account for omissions of which I may in
places be deemed guilty.</p>
<p>I will now take leave of my friends, assuring them that, if I
have not done all I might for their information and amusement, it
must be attributed to any other cause rather than a want of
desire and endeavour on my part.&nbsp; It would, indeed, be
unpardonable in me to deserve such an imputation, after having
received so many marks of attention from friends whom I have had
occasion more than once to consult in the progress of my
researches, and <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>being furnished with information from quarters where I
had not the least claim.</p>

rebellious practices of Glyndwr so exasperated King Henry against
the Welch people, that he enacted laws which in effect took away
all their liberties.&nbsp; They were rendered incapable of
purchasing any lands, or of being elected Members of any county
or borough; or of undertaking any office civil or military in any
town incorporate.&nbsp; No Englishman could be convicted of any
crime against a Welchman, but by an English judge and jury.&nbsp;
An Englishman, by marrying a Welch woman, was deprived of all his
privileges as an English subject.&nbsp; No Welchman could possess
any castle or place of defence, or be supplied with victuals or
armour, without a warrant from the King or from his Common
Council.&nbsp; And further it was enacted that no Welchman should
be capable of undertaking the office of Justice, Chamberlain,
Sheriff, or other place of trust, in any part of Wales;
notwithstanding any patent or license heretofore given to the
contrary.&nbsp; With other rigorous and unjust laws, forbidding
any Welchman from bringing up his children to learning, or
binding them to any trade or occupation.&nbsp; Henry V. at his
succession repealed these abominable laws.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
